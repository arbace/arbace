# Python as the tenth crop: survey and plan

Status: initial survey and plan, 2026-11-03, at the user's request (doc/JOURNAL.md, "2026-11-03: Haskell and Rust
unparked; Python's survey"). Nothing here is adopted: no code under `arbace/`, `go/`, `bin/`, `tools/` or `test/`
changed, and only this file was written. The decisions are the user's, as proposals PYS1-PYS20 (§12); the
milestones are PY1-PY11 (§11), named by PYS2.

Base: branch `python-survey` from main `422b7960`. The work is reading (the crop surveys, CLAUDE.md, GATE-SURVEY.md's
GT8) and probes of a few seconds each with the host's Python 3.14.10 (`ast`, `tokenize`, `symtable`, `dis`,
`marshal`, `compile` on files of a few lines and on the host's installed stdlib; scratch in the worktree's
`.tmp/python/`, Appendix A). No Arbace executable was built or run, no lock taken, nothing installed, nothing
downloaded. What the host does not hold (CPython's source tarball, `Lib/test`, pyperformance) is named from memory
of the projects, every such size, URL or license marked **to verify**, verified at the fetch the user decides (PYS1).

Words used throughout:

- **Python forms**: Python modules written as Arbace forms (§4), the counterpart of Go forms, Java forms, C forms
  and OCaml forms.
- **repr/python**: the bridge between Python text and Python forms (`arbace.repr.python`, `bin/repr-python read`,
  `print`, `roundtrip`, `check`), as repr/go, repr/c and repr/ocaml are.
- **pyi**: the evaluator of Python forms at the REPL and for programs (the name is PYS2's), as goi is Go's, oi
  OCaml's, si Scheme's, ci C's.
- **The oracle**: the host's CPython 3.14.10 (Alpine `python3-3.14.10-r1`), through a helper script
  `tools/pydump` (§5) that dumps what its `ast`, `tokenize`, `symtable` and `compile` see. **The judge** of runs is
  the same CPython, its runs recorded as data (§8.1).
- **The IR**: pyi's own intermediate form (§6.3), compiled by Arbace from Python forms, executed by pyi's frame
  machine and translated by the AOT (§7). It is Arbace's, not CPython's bytecode.

## Summary

- **Python is the first crop whose meaning is (almost) in its syntax.** Unlike OCaml (types, OC4), C++ (Sema,
  CP4) or Haskell, a Python program's semantics needs no type checker: the AST plus the scope analysis (`symtable`:
  local, global, nonlocal, free, cell; about 3,000 lines of C in CPython, to verify) decide every name, and
  everything else happens at run time through the data model. So **eval and AOT need no oracle dumps**: pyi
  can run from the forms alone, Arbace's own scope analysis checked against the oracle's `symtable` (§6.2). The
  oracle is needed for read (the parser) and as the reference of runs, and a native parser (§5.5) removes it from
  read too: Python can be the first crop that is standalone at every level in its first round.
- **The difficulty is breadth, not depth.** The data model (about 100 special methods, descriptors, metaclasses,
  the C3 MRO), the builtin types' surface (`str` alone has 47 methods), generators, coroutines and async
  generators, exception groups, `match`, f-strings and 3.14's t-strings, the import system, and a standard library
  of 595 Python modules (300,465 lines on the host, E2) over about 110 C modules (37 built in, 72 shared objects,
  E2). CPython's own test suite tests CPython's implementation details (reference counts, `gc`, the C API).
- **The host has everything for the oracle and nothing to install.** `python3` 3.14.10 (GIL build, `siphash13`,
  Unicode 16.0.0), with the stdlib as source (`/usr/lib/python3.14/*.py`), parses that stdlib in 2.8 s (1,082,411
  nodes, E2). `tokenize`'s full token stream round-trips byte for byte (80 of 80 stdlib files, E5), so mode
  `:full` needs no lexer of Arbace's at first, unlike OCaml's (OCAML-SURVEY §5.3). `compile()` is deterministic and
  `marshal` of a code object compiled from text equals that of the same AST (E7): a print level as strong as
  javac's class files byte for byte. `Lib/test` is the apk `python3-tests` (158 MiB installed, not installed) or the
  source tarball (PYS1).
- **Much of the stdlib's C has pure-Python twins in the stdlib itself** (E8): `_pyio` for `_io`, `_pydecimal` for
  `_decimal`, `_pydatetime` for `_datetime`, `_pylong`, `_py_abc`, `_py_warnings`, `re`'s compiler (only the
  matcher `_sre` is C), `json`'s and `pickle`'s pure paths, `importlib._bootstrap` for the import system. Read as
  Python forms, they shrink the Go ports to a list of about 25 modules (§6.6), as Scheme's crop runs psyntax and
  OCaml's runs its stdlib.
- **Recommended shape.** Python forms after the `ast` module's node names (PYS5); repr/python on the helper
  `tools/pydump` first, a native reader generated from CPython's own `Grammar/python.gram` by an Arbace port of
  pegen later (PYS3, PYS4); pyi as an IR compiled by Arbace and run by a frame machine in Go with heap frames, so
  generators and coroutines are suspended frames (PYS7); its runtime `go/arbace/py` in hand-written Go forms
  (PYS8); tracing GC with refcount timing a design class (PYS9); a GIL (PYS10); AOT as the IR translated to Go
  forms, a compiled interpreter at first, 1.5 to 3 times pyi (PYS13).
- **Plan (§11): PY1-PY11, about 57 to 98 working days**, of which the native reader (PY9) is 8 to 15; read and print
  alone (PY1-PY3, 9 to 14 days) give a round trip with no runtime commitment. The long poles are pyi's object model
  (PY5) and the stdlib's ports (PY6), as goi's GR3-GR10 and C5 were.
- **GT8 from day one (§10):** synthetic corpora by grammar rule and by special method, coverage subsets of
  `Lib/test` keyed per test method, and a measured cost per level before any corpus enters a tier. `Lib/test` whole
  under an interpreter on Go is far over 35 minutes a night (§10.2).
- **To decide first (§13):** the pin (PYS1), the oracle and the native reader's order (PYS3, PYS4), eval's
  representation (PYS7), finalization (PYS9), the stdlib's strategy (PYS11), the crop's place in the order
  (PYS19).

## 1. What parity means

Under the crops' rule (doc/FULL-SUPPORT-SURVEY.md, "The binding decisions" and "REAP v1's divergences"; C23-SURVEY
§1; OCAML-SURVEY §1): on the host (linux/amd64), forms only, each level's results recorded as data, `bin/reap`
judging from the records with no runs, none failing, every non-pass in a recorded class.

| cell | in Arbace (proposed) | corpus | reference | judge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Python read** | repr/python `read` (the helper's dump converted; later the native reader, PY9) | the stdlib, `Lib/test`, the site-packages set, the samples, synthetic (§8.2) | CPython 3.14.10's acceptance (`ast.parse`), its `SyntaxError` (class, message, position) and its `ast` (`ast.dump` with attributes) | trees equal to the helper's as data; the print compiled by CPython gives the original's code object (E7); a rejected file rejected with the same message and position |
| **Python eval** | pyi (the IR on the frame machine) | the run programs: synthetic, `Lib/test` per test method, benchmarks | CPython 3.14.10's runs of the originals, recorded (status, stdout, stderr's last line; §8.1) | byte for byte after the recorded masks (addresses); per test method for `Lib/test` |
| **Python AOT** | the IR → Go forms → `arbace.build.go` (PYS13) | as eval | as eval | as eval; pyi and compiled compared (diffcheck's kind) |
| **Python print** | repr/python `print` (`:lines`, `:full`) | every read corpus | the original text; the forms read back; CPython's AST and code objects of the print | `:full` byte for byte; `:lines` forms → Python → forms equal, `ast.dump` equal, code objects equal without positions (E7) |

What differs from the other crops:

- **No semantic oracle for eval.** The read level needs CPython's parser until PY9; eval and AOT need only CPython's
  recorded runs. The scope analysis is Arbace's, checked against `symtable` (PY5).
- **Two tiers of rejection.** `ast.parse` accepts what the compiler then rejects (E6: `case [1, *rest] | {"k": _}`
  parses; `compile` raises "alternative patterns bind different names"; `return` outside a function, `nonlocal`
  errors, `await` outside `async`, likewise). The read level judges `ast.parse`'s acceptance; the compiler's and
  `symtable`'s errors are eval's (pyi's compiler reports them before a run, as CPython does), judged as runs (the
  `SyntaxError` at compile time is a run's status and stderr).
- **CPython's own suite is a test of CPython.** `Lib/test` uses `@cpython_only`, `support.check_impl_detail()`,
  `sys.getrefcount`, `gc.get_referrers`, `_testcapi` and C-level modules; PyPy runs it with
  `sys.implementation.name == 'pypy'` and a skip list (to verify). pyi does the same (PYS15).

## 2. The host and prior art

### 2.1 The host

- `python3-3.14.10-r1` (Alpine edge main, `PSF-2.0`, 22 MiB installed): `Python 3.14.10 (main, Oct 27 2026,
  09:53:04) [GCC 15.2.0]`, musl, **the GIL build** (`sys._is_gil_enabled()` true), `hash_info.algorithm` `siphash13`,
  `unicodedata.unidata_version` 16.0.0, `int_max_str_digits` 4300. `python3-pyc` installed.
- Available, not installed: `python3-tests` (158 MiB installed: `Lib/test`), `python3-dev` (101 MiB: headers, the
  static library, `config/`), `python3-doc` (22 KiB, a stub). No `Lib/test`, no `Grammar/`, no `Parser/`, no
  `Tools/peg_generator` on the host: those need the source tarball (PYS1).
- `/usr/lib/python3.14/site-packages`: Alpine's `py3-*` packages, 1,180 `.py` files, 461,735 lines, 4 shared
  objects (`attrs`, `certifi`, `charset_normalizer`, `idna`, `jinja2`, `jsonschema`, `packaging`, `pip`,
  `pyparsing`, `requests`, `setuptools`, `urllib3`, `yaml` with `_yaml`, `typing_extensions`, `wcwidth`, `pyte`,
  `coverage`, `markupsafe`, `cloudinit`, ...): a read corpus already on the host, pinned by the apks' versions (§8.2).

### 2.2 What 3.14 adds (the facts the forms must carry; to verify against the release notes)

- PEP 750 template strings: `t"..."` gives `TemplateStr` with `Interpolation` nodes (present in the probe's `ast`,
  E3); mixing them with plain literals in an implicit concatenation is a syntax error (E6).
- PEP 758: `except A, B:` without parentheses, the same tree as `except (A, B):` (E4).
- PEP 649 / PEP 749: annotations evaluated lazily (`__annotate__`, `annotationlib`): eval's semantics, not the tree's.
- PEP 765: `return`/`break`/`continue` leaving a `finally` block warns (`SyntaxWarning`): a compile-time warning
  on stderr, judged as runs.
- PEP 779: the free-threaded build supported (not the host's); PEP 734: `concurrent.interpreters`; PEP 784:
  `compression.zstd` (not among the host's shared objects); the incremental GC; the tail-calling interpreter and
  the experimental JIT (implementation details, invisible to the judge).
- Since 3.12: PEP 701 (f-strings parsed by the grammar, tokenized in a mode of their own: the hardest part of a
  native lexer, §5.5), PEP 695 (type parameters, `type X = ...`), PEP 709 (comprehensions inlined: visible to
  `symtable`, to tracebacks and to `locals()`).

### 2.3 Prior art (from memory, to verify)

- **CPython** (github.com/python/cpython, tag `v3.14.10`): `Grammar/python.gram` (the PEG grammar, of the order of
  1,500 lines, with `invalid_*` rules that give the error messages in a second pass), `Parser/` (the generated
  `parser.c`, `action_helpers.c`, the lexer `Parser/lexer/` and `Parser/tokenizer/`), `Tools/peg_generator/` (pegen,
  in Python, with C and Python back ends), `Python/symtable.c`, `Python/compile.c`, `Python/codegen.c`,
  `Python/flowgraph.c`, `Python/ceval.c` with `Python/bytecodes.c`, `Objects/` (the types), `Modules/`, `Lib/`.
- **gpython** (github.com/go-python/gpython, BSD-3-Clause): a Python 3.4 interpreter in Go (frames, a bytecode VM
  compatible with 3.4's, a partial stdlib). The closest design in Go; too old to vendor, a reference for the
  object model's Go shape.
- **starlark-go** (github.com/google/starlark-go, BSD-3-Clause): a Python dialect in Go (no classes, no
  exceptions); a reference for a tree compiler and a small VM in Go.
- **grumpy** (github.com/google/grumpy, Apache-2.0, abandoned): Python 2.7 transpiled to Go: the AOT idea of
  §7 (generic ops called from generated Go), with its known limits (no `exec`/`eval` of new code).
- **PyPy** (MIT): `lib_pypy/` holds pure-Python versions of C modules (`_functools`, `_collections`, `_csv`,
  `_structseq`, `_sqlite3` over cffi, ...), a vendoring source for §6.6; and its way of running `Lib/test`
  (`sys.implementation`, `check_impl_detail`).
- **RustPython** (MIT): a Python 3 interpreter in Rust with a compiler of its own and a partial stdlib; a
  reference for which C modules a non-CPython must provide first.
- **MicroPython** (MIT), **GraalPy** (UPL), **Jython** (PSF, 2.7), **IronPython** (Apache-2.0): references only.
- **hypothesmith** (MPL-2.0): programs generated from the grammar, prior art for §8.3's synthetic corpus.

### 2.4 What Arbace already has

- The repr family's helper pattern: `tools/hsdump` (GHC), `tools/rsdump` (rustc), `tools/ocdump` (compiler-libs),
  `tools/ccdump`, `tools/cxxdump`, `tools/schemedump`; for Python the helper is a script on the host's interpreter,
  with no build (§5.1).
- repr/c's native lexer, preprocessor and parser (ports checked token for token and tree for tree,
  `bin/repr-c parse-check`), repr/java's JN8 parser checked with 8,000 mutants for error recovery, repr/go's GP5: the
  pattern of PY9.
- goi's check machinery (`--record-ref`, `divergences`, controls, CPU limits `bin/lib/limit.bash`, essential
  subsets), oi's and si's runtimes in Go forms (`go/arbace/oi`, `go/arbace/scm`) with their AOT (o2j; Scheme's IR
  → Go forms, SC9 (a)), si's heap frames (SCHEME-SURVEY §5.2 (a)), OCaml's effects by goroutine hand-off (OC6).
- ci's runtime `go/arbace/crt` (libc's system calls in Go) and musl 1.2.6 as C forms with cf2g, and jrt's zlib ports
  (`Deflater`, `Inflater`), `x509roots/`: bases for `posix`, `math` (musl's libm: the host CPython's `math` is musl's,
  so bit-identical results come from the same C), `zlib`, `_ssl` (§6.6).

## 3. Measurements

Probes (seconds each; Appendix A):

- **E1, the host.** `python3 -VV`, `apk info`, `sys.flags`, `sys.hash_info`: as §2.1.
- **E2, the stdlib on the host.** 595 `.py` files outside `site-packages`, 300,465 lines, 11.0 MB; all parsed by
  `ast.parse` in 2.8 s, 1,082,411 nodes, no syntax error. 37 built-in modules (`_abc`, `_ast`, `_codecs`,
  `_collections`, `_contextvars`, `_datetime`, `_functools`, `_imp`, `_io`, `_locale`, `_opcode`, `_operator`,
  `_signal`, `_sre`, `_stat`, `_string`, `_suggestions`, `_symtable`, `_sysconfig`, `_thread`, `_tokenize`,
  `_tracemalloc`, `_types`, `_typing`, `_warnings`, `_weakref`, `atexit`, `builtins`, `errno`, `faulthandler`, `gc`,
  `itertools`, `marshal`, `posix`, `pwd`, `sys`, `time`) and 72 shared objects in `lib-dynload` (14 of them test
  modules: `_testcapi`, `_testinternalcapi`, `xxlimited`, ...).
- **E3, the `ast` module.** 132 node classes, 119 leaves, 6 of them deprecated aliases (`AugLoad`, `AugStore`,
  `ExtSlice`, `Index`, `Param`, `Suite`): about 113 live node kinds, of which 37 are operator and context
  singletons. Smaller than OCaml's Parsetree and Go's `go/ast` together.
- **E4, the tree is lossy.** On `x = (1 + 2) * 0x1F  # trailing`: the comment gone; the parentheses gone (the inner
  `BinOp` spans columns 5-10, the outer 4-18: parentheses survive only as a gap between positions); `0x1F` is
  `Constant(31)` (the spelling recoverable from the positions); `'a' "b" f"{x!r:>{w}}"` one `JoinedStr`; `except
  ValueError, TypeError:` the same tree as the parenthesized form; a backslash continuation and `;` invisible.
  `ast.unparse` re-spells all of them (`f'ab{x!r:>{w}}'`, `except (ValueError, TypeError):`). Column offsets are
  **UTF-8 byte offsets** (`y = é`: 15 to 17).
- **E5, tokens round-trip.** `tokenize.untokenize` of the full token stream (5-tuples, `COMMENT` and `NL`
  included) equals the source bytes on a file with non-ASCII names, `;`, a backslash continuation and a bracket
  continuation, and on 80 of 80 stdlib files (0.58 s).
- **E6, two tiers of rejection.** `ast.parse` rejects `'a' t"t{x}"` ("cannot mix t-string literals with string or
  bytes literals", with a caret span) and accepts `case [1, *rest] | {"k": _} if rest:` which `compile` rejects
  ("alternative patterns bind different names").
- **E7, code objects as a print level.** `marshal.dumps(compile(src))` equals `marshal.dumps(compile(ast.parse(src)))`
  (1,379 bytes) and two compiles are equal: compilation is deterministic. The source `ast.unparse` prints gives an
  equal `ast.dump` and code objects equal without positions (`co_code`, constants, names, local names,
  recursively), but different `marshal` bytes (the line and column table). So: `:lines` judged at code without
  positions, `:full` at `marshal` bytes. Bytecode is 3.14's own (`LOAD_FAST_BORROW`, `LOAD_SMALL_INT`): a reason
  not to interpret it (PYS7).
- **E8, pure-Python twins.** `_pyio` 2,764 lines, `_pydecimal` 6,503, `_pydatetime` 2,734, `_pylong` 729, `_py_abc` 152,
  `_py_warnings` 869, `re/_compiler.py` 782 and `re/_parser.py` 1,066, `importlib/_bootstrap.py` 1,570 and
  `_bootstrap_external.py` 1,566. Module kinds: `collections`, `functools`, `operator`, `json`, `re`, `io`,
  `decimal`, `datetime`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `random`, `struct`, `pickle`, `enum`, `dataclasses`, `typing`, `abc`,
  `copy`, `unittest`, `asyncio`, `contextlib`, `weakref`, `hashlib`, `os` are `.py` (some over a C accelerator);
  `itertools`, `time` built in; `math`, `array`, `unicodedata` shared objects.
- **E9, hash order.** `list({'apple','pear','fig','kiwi','plum'})` is the same under `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` twice, another
  order under seed 1 and another unseeded: recorded runs need a fixed seed and pyi needs CPython's `siphash13` with
  the same key derivation to print sets of strings in the same order (§8.1). `object()`'s repr carries an address
  (`<object object at 0x7fd3b3644200>`): masked, as Java's identity hash codes are.

## 4. Python forms

### 4.1 Principles

The other crops' (doc/go/SPEC.md, doc/ocaml/SPEC.md §1): data readable by the Clojure reader, one form per node,
`(head field...)` with an optional trailing metadata map, keywords for flags, vectors for lists, positions in mode
`:full` only, names spelled as the source. The heads are the `ast` classes' names in Arbace's spelling (PYS5 (a)):
`FunctionDef` → `function-def`, `AsyncFor` → `async-for`, `BinOp` → `bin-op`, `MatchClass` → `match-class`,
`TemplateStr` → `template-str`; the operator singletons are symbols (`+`, `//`, `@`, `**`, `not in`, `is not`,
`and`), so the converter is near the identity, as OCaml's is with the Parsetree (OC8). One top form per file:
`(python/module ...)`; the other `ast.parse` modes `(python/interactive ...)` (the REPL), `(python/expression ...)`
(`eval`), `(python/function-type ...)` (type comments).

### 4.2 What the forms keep and drop

- **Dropped and checked:** `ctx` (`Load`, `Store`, `Del`): the slot decides it; the converter checks the helper's
  value against the slot's, so nothing is lost (a test, not a field).
- **Kept beyond the `ast`:** the literal's spelling (`0x1F`, `1_000`, `1e3`, `'it''s'` concatenations, `r"\d"`, the
  string prefixes and quotes) always, as OCaml's forms keep `Pconst_integer`'s text (its SPEC's S6): the value
  is computed from the spelling by the reader, and the helper checks the two agree. Implicit concatenation keeps its
  parts (`(str-concat "a" "b" (f-string ...))`) where `ast` merges them.
- **Positions** (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, `end_col_offset`, UTF-8 bytes, E4) in `:full`'s metadata, so
  the print can give `compile`'s line table (E7).
- **Type comments** (`# type: int`, `ast.parse(type_comments=True)`) as metadata of their node; `TypeIgnore` in the
  module's metadata.
- **Docstrings** are ordinary `Expr(Constant(str))` statements; the forms keep them so (the compiler's choice to
  store them as `__doc__` is eval's).

Examples (proposed, to fix at PY1):

```
(function-def f [(type-param T)] (arguments {:posonly [(arg a T)] :vararg (arg b) :kwonly [(arg k)]
              :kw-defaults [1] :kwarg (arg kw)})
  [(return (if-exp a a k))] {:returns T})                          ; def f[T](a: T, /, *b, k=1, **kw) -> T: return a if a else k
(assign [x] (bin-op * (bin-op + 1 2) (int "0x1F")))                ; x = (1 + 2) * 0x1F
(match x [(match-case (match-sequence [(match-value 1) (match-star rest)]) :guard rest [(pass)])])
```

### 4.3 Layout of the `.ae` files

One `.ae` per `.py`, the forms of `:lines` pretty-printed by the family's layout (`arbace.repr.java.layout`'s
widths, as repr/go's and repr/ocaml's), mode `:full`'s token stream in a trailing block as repr/clojure keeps a
`.cljc`'s conditionals; packages as directories (`__init__.ae`), as Go forms' packages are.

## 5. repr/python: read and print

### 5.1 The pipeline

`bin/repr-python read FILE` → helper `tools/pydump/pydump.py` run as `python3 -I -S -B` (isolated: no user site,
no current directory on the path, no `.pyc` written; the script reads files given as arguments, the convention for
untrusted inputs) → forms written by the helper in this spec's vocabulary (as `ocdump` writes OCaml forms) →
the converter `arbace.repr.python.convert` (checks, literal spelling, `.ae`) → Python forms. `print` → the printer
`arbace.repr.python.print` (precedence-aware parenthesization, indentation) → Python text.

The helper's modes: `tree` (`ast.parse(..., type_comments=True)` with attributes, the literals' source segments),
`tokens` (`tokenize.tokenize`, E5), `error` (`SyntaxError`'s class, `msg`, `lineno`, `offset`, `end_lineno`,
`end_offset`, `text`), `symtable` (scopes and each name's flags, for pyi's check, PY5), `code` (the `marshal`
digest of `compile`, and the positionless signature of E7, for print's levels). Unlike `hsdump` and `rsdump` it is
**not built**: its pin is the interpreter's (`tools/pydump/PYTHON_VERSION` with the apk's name and the
interpreter's `sys.version`, checked at each run as `GHC_VERSION` is).

### 5.2 Modes

`:lines` (forms; text → forms → text → forms equal) and `:full` (the text byte for byte from the token stream, E5,
with the comments and `NL` tokens woven by position). The print's levels, from repr/go's and repr/haskell's:

1. **forms**: Python → forms → Python → forms equal;
2. **ast**: `ast.dump` (without attributes) of the print equal to the original's;
3. **code**: the print's code objects equal to the original's without positions (E7), recursively;
4. **text**: `:full` printed byte for byte;
5. **marshal**: `:full`'s print compiled gives `marshal` bytes equal to the original's (positions included; with
   level 4 this is redundant but checks the helper);
6. **behaviour**: the run programs (§8.2) run from the print, as from the original (eval's references).

### 5.3 Errors

A file `ast.parse` rejects is a corpus case judged on the exception's class (`SyntaxError`, `IndentationError`,
`TabError`), message and span (E6), as goi's error tests are judged on gc's syntax errors. CPython's messages come
from the grammar's `invalid_*` rules, so a native reader generated from the same grammar (§5.5) produces them
without a table.

### 5.4 Encodings and lines

PEP 263 coding cookies, a UTF-8 BOM, `\r\n` and `\r` line ends, form feeds in indentation, tabs (`TabError`): `:full`
keeps the bytes (E5's round trip is in bytes); the forms hold the decoded text. Files that are not UTF-8 (a
`latin-1` cookie in `Lib/test`'s data) are corpus cases of their own.

### 5.5 The native reader (PY9; PYS4)

The JN8/GP5/C2 step: a lexer port of `Parser/lexer/` (indentation, the f-string and t-string modes of PEP 701,
numeric literals, the `type_comments` mode) and a parser **generated from `Grammar/python.gram` by an Arbace port of
pegen** (`Tools/peg_generator/pegen`: the grammar's grammar, the first-sets and left-recursion analysis, a back end
emitting Arbace with memoization), the grammar's C actions (`_PyAST_*` constructors and `action_helpers.c`'s
helpers, about 1,700 lines, to verify) translated into form constructors. Its check is `parse-check`: every corpus
file and N mutants parsed by both, the forms and the errors equal, against a known file. A native reader makes
read, eval and AOT need no CPython at all, the host's Python remaining only as the reference of recorded runs.

## 6. eval: pyi

### 6.1 What eval means for Python

A REPL (`bin/pyi`, the `python3` REPL's behaviour for expression statements: `repr` of a non-`None` value, `_`), and
program runs (`bin/pyi run FILE ARGS`, `-c`, `-m MODULE`) with `sys.argv`, the exit status (`SystemExit`, uncaught
exceptions: 1, the traceback on stderr), stdout and stderr. Python forms evaluated at Arbace's REPL as goi's are
(PYS20).

### 6.2 The parts

1. **The scope analysis** `arbace.python.scope`: CPython's `symtable` (module, class, function, lambda,
   comprehension and annotation scopes; PEP 709's inlined comprehensions; PEP 695's type-parameter scopes; PEP
   649's annotation scopes), with its errors. Checked name by name against the helper's `symtable` dump over every
   corpus (a check as goi's checker is checked against go/types).
2. **The compiler** `arbace.python.compile`: forms → the IR (§6.3), with the compiler's errors (E6) and warnings.
3. **The runtime** `go/arbace/py` (hand-written Go forms, in goi's table like `go/arbace/scm` and `go/arbace/oi`): the
   object model (§6.4), the frame machine, the built-in modules (§6.6).
4. **The library** `python/Lib/`: the stdlib's Python modules as Python forms, vendored and embedded (§6.6).
5. **The tools** `bin/pyi run|check|test|divergences|record-ref`, `arbace.python.check` on the tools' host, as goi's.

### 6.3 The IR and the frame machine (PYS7)

Python's semantics lives in frames: generators, coroutines and async generators are suspended frames; tracebacks
are a chain of frames with their positions; `sys._getframe`, `f_locals` (PEP 667's write-through proxies),
`sys.settrace` and `sys.setprofile` (which `coverage`, `pdb` and parts of `Lib/test` use) inspect them; recursion is
bounded by `sys.getrecursionlimit()` (1,000 by default), not by memory. So pyi compiles each code object to an IR of
its own (a register or stack code with an exception table, CPython-like in shape, Arbace's in detail and stable
across CPython releases) and runs it on **heap frames** in a loop in Go: a generator's `yield` returns from the loop
keeping the frame, `send` resumes it; `await` is the same; an exception unwinds through the exception table; the Go
stack never holds Python frames, so a deep Python recursion is a `RecursionError` exactly where CPython raises it.

The alternative (b), goi's closure tree on Go's stack with generators on goroutines (OC6's hand-off), is faster for
plain calls and pays a goroutine switch (hundreds of nanoseconds or more) at every `yield`, which Python code does in
every `for` over a generator; and it cannot give `f_lineno`, `settrace` or exact `RecursionError` without the same
bookkeeping a frame machine has. Interpreting CPython's bytecode (c) ties pyi to 3.14's opcodes (E7) and needs the
oracle to compile.

### 6.4 The object model

- **Objects**: a Go interface over structs with a pointer to their type; **types are objects** with C3 MROs, the
  slots CPython's `tp_*` caches (`__getattribute__`, `__call__`, `__hash__`, `__eq__`, the number and sequence
  protocols) filled from the class dictionary and invalidated on assignment, as CPython's type version tags do.
- **The data model**: attribute lookup with data and non-data descriptors, `__slots__`, `__getattr__`, properties,
  `classmethod`/`staticmethod`, `super()` (the `__class__` cell), metaclasses with `__prepare__`, `__init_subclass__`,
  `__set_name__`, `__class_getitem__`, `__mro_entries__`; the binary operators' reflected-operand rule and
  `NotImplemented`; rich comparison; `__index__`, `__format__`, `__hash__` = `None`; the context manager, iterator and
  async protocols; `__match_args__`.
- **Numbers**: `int` arbitrary precision (an `int64` fast path, `math/big` beyond; CPython's results for `//`, `%`,
  `**` with negatives, `pow(a, b, m)`, `int.to_bytes`, the 4,300-digit limit on `str(int)`); `float` with CPython's
  `repr` (the shortest round-trip digits, `1e+16`, `inf`, `nan`; Go's `strconv` shortest digits formatted by
  CPython's rules), `float.__format__`'s mini-language, `round` with ties to even, `math` from musl's libm (§2.4);
  `complex`; `bool` as an `int` subclass; hashing of numbers by the modulus `2**61 - 1` (E1).
- **Strings**: code-point sequences with O(1) indexing (PEP 393's Latin-1/UCS-2/UCS-4 storage, or `[]rune`), lone
  surrogates allowed (`surrogateescape`, `surrogatepass`), Unicode 16.0.0's data for `str.isidentifier`,
  `casefold`, `upper` (from the UCD files, pinned: Go's `unicode` tables are of another version, to verify); `bytes`,
  `bytearray`, `memoryview` with the buffer protocol.
- **Containers**: `dict` insertion-ordered (CPython's compact layout's iteration order, and its errors on mutation
  during iteration), `set` and `frozenset` (their iteration order follows the hash and the table's growth: CPython's
  probing reproduced, with `siphash13`, E9), `list` (Timsort, stable, the same comparisons in the same order:
  `sort` with a key that prints is observable), `tuple`, `range`, `slice`.
- **Exceptions**: the built-in hierarchy (about 70 classes), `__context__`, `__cause__`, `__suppress_context__`,
  `__traceback__`, `add_note`, `BaseExceptionGroup`/`ExceptionGroup` with `except*`; tracebacks printed with 3.11's
  carets (`~~~^^^`), judged on their last line by default (§8.1).
- **Functions**: defaults, keyword-only and positional-only parameters, `*args`/`**kwargs`, closures (cells),
  `__wrapped__`, `functools.partial`; bound methods; `__code__` attributes as far as the IR can answer.
- **Identity**: `id()` a stable number per object (not an address), `is` on interned small ints (-5 to 256) and
  interned strings as CPython interns them (observable through `is`: a class where it differs).

### 6.5 Memory, finalization, threads

- **Finalization (PYS9).** CPython frees an object when its count reaches zero: `__del__` runs, a weak reference's
  callback fires, an unclosed file is flushed and warns (`ResourceWarning`) at that point; programs and tests rely
  on it (`del x; assert wr() is None`). On Go's tracing GC that timing cannot be had without counting. v1: Go's GC, a
  finalizer queue drained at `gc.collect()` and at safe points, `sys.getrefcount` a class; the size of the class
  measured at PY7 before deciding whether pyi counts references (b).
- **Threads (PYS10).** `threading` over goroutines with a GIL (one Python thread runs at a time, switched every
  `sys.getswitchinterval()` at the IR's back edges and calls), which is the host build's semantics and makes the
  object model's structures need no locks; the free-threaded semantics a later option.
- **Signals**: `signal` handlers run between IR instructions on the main thread, as CPython runs them;
  `KeyboardInterrupt`.

### 6.6 The standard library (PYS11)

- **Python modules as forms**: the 595 stdlib modules read by repr/python into `python/Lib/` (committed like
  `jdk/`, `tamago/goroot/`, by a `bin/python-vendor convert|verify`), with the pure twins (E8) taking the C modules'
  places: `_pyio` as `io`'s implementation, `_pydecimal`, `_pydatetime`, `_pylong`, `_py_abc`, `_py_warnings`,
  `json`'s Python scanner and encoder, `pickle`'s Python `Pickler`, `heapq`'s, `bisect`'s, `functools`' and
  `collections`' pure parts, `asyncio`'s pure `Task` and `Future`, `ElementTree`'s Python parser front; and
  `importlib._bootstrap` and `_bootstrap_external` as **the import system** (PYS12): frozen into the executable as
  CPython freezes them, a source-only loader (no `.pyc`), `sys.path` naming the embedded `python/Lib`.
- **Go ports** (a list to fix at PY6; sizes of CPython's C to verify): `builtins`, `sys`, `_io`'s minimum under
  `_pyio` (`FileIO` over `crt`), `posix` (on `go/arbace/crt`), `_thread`, `_weakref`, `_imp`, `marshal` (for its
  format, `importlib`'s needs), `_codecs` and the encodings' C parts, `_sre` (the matcher, `Modules/_sre/sre_lib.h`,
  of the order of 3,000 lines; Go's `regexp` is RE2 and cannot do back references), `math` and `cmath` (musl's libm
  as C forms through cf2g, or Go's `math` with a class for the last bit), `itertools`, `_struct`, `array`,
  `_random` (Mersenne Twister, bit-exact for seeded runs), `unicodedata` (UCD 16.0.0), `binascii`, `zlib` (jrt's ports
  or Go's `compress/flate`; byte-exact `compress` output needs zlib's own deflate), `_hashlib`/`_md5`/`_sha1`/`_sha2`/
  `_sha3`/`_blake2` (Go's `crypto`), `time`, `select`, `_socket`, `errno`, `_stat`, `_string`, `_locale` (the C
  locale), `_contextvars`, `_tokenize` (the native lexer of PY9, or a class until then), `_ast` (Python forms ↔ `ast`
  objects: the bridge that makes `ast.parse` inside pyi the native reader), `_symtable`, `atexit`, `gc`, `faulthandler`
  (a class).
- **Deferred, classes in v1**: `_ctypes`, `_sqlite3`, `_ssl` (until `x509roots` and Go's TLS are wired), `_curses`,
  `readline`, `_tkinter`, `_lzma`, `_bz2` (Go has no compressor), `_zstd`, the CJK codecs, `_interpreters`,
  `_remote_debugging`, `_lsprof`, `_tracemalloc`, the `_test*` modules.
- **C modules through the C crop** (PYS11 (b), later): self-contained C cores (`sre_lib.h`'s matcher, libmpdec,
  `_randommodule.c`'s generator, expat, HACL*) read as C forms by repr/c and translated by cf2g, with the glue
  written by hand; a general C API emulation (as PyPy's cpyext) is out of scope.

## 7. AOT

Python's dynamism makes the first AOT a **compiled interpreter**: each code object's IR translated to a Go function
that calls the runtime's generic operations (`py.Add(a, b)`, `py.GetAttr(o, "x")`) with the dispatch loop, the
operand stack and the instruction decoding gone; generators as Go state machines over a heap frame (a `switch` on
the resume point); exceptions as returned statuses, as goi does for Go's panics; `exec`, `eval` and `compile` at run
time link pyi into the program. That is Nuitka's and grumpy's shape; realistic gains are 1.5 to 3 times pyi on
call- and loop-heavy code, little on code that spends its time in `dict` and `str`. Type feedback (an int loop
specialized under a guard, as CPython 3.11's specializing interpreter and its JIT do) is a later step
(FUTAMURA-SURVEY's F10 kind).

The path (PYS13): the IR → Go forms printed by repr/go and built by `arbace.build.go` over `go/arbace/py`, as
Scheme's AOT (SC9 (a)): the runtime is Go forms already, and Java forms (OCaml's o2j path, OC7) would add j2g's
translation of closures and statuses for nothing. The check: `bin/pyi check --aot` over the run corpora against the
same references, and pyi against compiled per program (diffcheck's kind).

## 8. The oracle, the references and the corpora

### 8.1 The references

- **Runs recorded as data** (`test/python/ref-cpython314.edn`, `bin/pyi record-ref`, as `bin/java-check
  --record-ref` and ci's `ref-gcc15`): each program run by the host's `python3` under a fixed environment
  (`PYTHONHASHSEED=0`, `-I`, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`, no
  terminal), its status, stdout's digest and text, stderr's last line and digest. The check needs no Python.
- **Masks**: addresses in default reprs (`at 0x...`), `id()` values, timings, and the traceback's text beyond its
  last line (a second, stricter judge on the full traceback where the programs print positions, PYS14).
- **`Lib/test`**: run by its own runner (`python3 -m test -v MODULE` or `unittest -v`), each test method a case
  (`ok`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, `skipped 'reason'`, `expected failure`), as Clojure's suite is judged per test
  (PYS15); a module that does not import is one case.

### 8.2 The corpora

| corpus | source | size | license | use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the stdlib | `Lib/` of the pinned tarball (the host's 595 files as a first measure, E2) | about 600 modules, 300k lines (host); the tarball's `Lib/` without tests to verify | PSF-2.0 | read, print; the library pyi runs (§6.6); AOT |
| `Lib/test` | the pinned tarball's `Lib/test/` (or apk `python3-tests`, 158 MiB installed) | of the order of 2,000 `.py` files and 800k lines, about 500 `test_*` modules, to verify | PSF-2.0 | read, print (with its deliberately bad files: `badsyntax_*`, `bad_coding*`, `tokenizedata/`); eval and AOT per test method (§8.1) |
| `test_grammar`, `test_syntax`, `test_exceptions`, `test_patma`, `test_fstring`, `test_tstring`, `test_type_params`, `test_generators`, `test_coroutines`, `test_descr`, `test_class` | inside `Lib/test` | a few dozen modules | PSF-2.0 | the language core: the first eval corpus |
| site-packages | the host's `py3-*` apks (§2.1), each pinned by name and version | 1,180 files, 461,735 lines | MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0, PSF (each package's, to verify) | read, print; later eval of pure ones (`attrs`, `idna`, `packaging`, `pyparsing`, `jinja2`) |
| pyperformance | github.com/python/pyperformance, a pinned release (to verify) | about 80 benchmarks, of which the pure-Python ones (`nbody`, `richards`, `chaos`, `deltablue`, `fannkuch`, `float`, `go`, `hexiom`, `nqueens`, `pidigits`, `raytrace`, `spectral_norm`, `unpack_sequence`, `json_dumps`, `pyflate`, ...) | MIT (to verify) | eval and AOT, with their outputs; speed |
| benchmarksgame | the benchmarks game's Python programs (C's crop pins only its C programs, from `modernc.org/ccorpus2@v1.6.0` in `test/c/corpora.edn`; the Python ones a fetch, to verify) | tens of programs | BSD-3-Clause (revised, to verify) | eval, AOT, speed |
| synthetic | generated (§8.3) | hundreds of small programs | Arbace's | every level; the essential subsets |
| samples | `test/python/samples/`, one file per construct of §4 | tens | Arbace's | every level |

### 8.3 Synthetic corpora (GT8.6, GTS207 (a))

From the start, as GT8 asks of a new crop: (1) one program per rule and alternative of `python.gram`, including its
`invalid_*` rules (an error each), for read, print and the native reader; (2) one program per special method and per
built-in type's method (the data model's table and `builtins`' surface), printing its results, for eval and AOT; (3)
per statement and expression kind, the generator, coroutine and exception paths (`yield` inside `try`/`finally`,
`return` in a generator, `throw`, `close`, `aclose`, `except*` splits). Each is run by the same CPython and recorded
(GTS207 (a)); generated by an Arbace generator from the grammar and the data model's list, committed with its seed.

## 9. Licenses

`LICENSE.md` gains Python: CPython's **PSF License Agreement for Python 3.14** (PSF-2.0, "Python Software Foundation
License Version 2", permissive, with its own text and the history of the BeOpen, CNRI and CWI licenses it carries),
covering `Lib/`, `Grammar/`, `Parser/`, `Tools/peg_generator/` and the C sources read or ported; and the licenses of
what CPython bundles that a port touches: libmpdec (BSD-2-Clause), expat (MIT), HACL* (MIT or Apache-2.0), zlib
(zlib), mimalloc (MIT), the Unicode data (Unicode-3.0), `Lib/test`'s data files under the same PSF terms (all to
verify against `LICENSE` and `Doc/license.rst` of the pinned tarball). Vendoring `Lib/` as Python forms keeps the
files' notices (PSF's terms ask that the license and its notice be retained) and lists the files in `LICENSE.md`.
gpython (BSD-3-Clause), PyPy (MIT) and RustPython (MIT) are read as references; a vendored piece of PyPy's
`lib_pypy` would add MIT. pyperformance's and the site-packages' licenses per package (to verify).

## 10. The row and GT8's budget

### 10.1 The row

`test/reap/cells.edn` gains `:python` with four cells and the classes files
(`test/python/divergences{,-read,-aot,-print}.edn`); the Makefile gains `repr-python-*` and `pyi-*` targets
(`make check-makefile`). As the other crops since OC120 (b), its steps enter the gate only when its row fits GT8's
budget (the journal, 2026-11-03).

### 10.2 The budget (GTS201 (a): about 35 minutes nightly, about 2.4 hours clean, a share of the essential 15 minutes)

| tier | Python's content (proposed) | estimate (to measure at PY2, PY5, PY7) |
|---|---|---|
| essential (a share of 15 min, about 1 min) | the samples at every level; the synthetic core (a coverage subset of §8.3); 50 stdlib files read and printed `:full`; one AOT program of the synthetic core | under 60 s, on stage 0 and the gate's executable |
| nightly (35 min) | read and print of every corpus file (stdlib, site-packages, `Lib/test`'s files), deduplicated (GT8.2); eval and AOT over the coverage subset of `Lib/test`'s test methods (GTS205 (a): every block of `go/arbace/py` and of the compiler reached, every class with one case, the controls, every deferred case) plus the rotation's seventh (GTS203 (a)); the native reader's `parse-check` over the corpus and a seventh of the mutants | read: CPython parses the stdlib in 2.8 s (E2); the helper's dump, the converter and the print at 50 to 100 times that is 3 to 5 min for all read corpora; eval: see below |
| clean (2.4 h) | every part over the compressed corpora, audited; the rotation's record complete | within 2.4 h if the nightly is within 35 min |

**Why `Lib/test` whole cannot be nightly.** CPython runs its whole suite in roughly 10 to 30 minutes serially (to
verify; `-j` shortens it); an interpreter on Go's runtime is likely 3 to 20 times slower than CPython's specializing
interpreter at first (gpython's and RustPython's reported factors, to verify), so the whole suite is hours under pyi.
The coverage subset (GTS205/GTS206: `go build -cover` of the program, the test methods that reach every block) is
the nightly's, the rest rotates over seven nights, and the slow modules (`test_math`'s exhaustive cases,
`test_decimal`'s `decimaltestdata`, `test_unicodedata`'s full check, the `test_asyncio` package) get per-test CPU
limits as Java's `speed` curation does (GTS102, GTS208). Each level's measured cost is recorded with its first record
(GT8.1) and a level over its share compresses before its corpus grows (GTS201 (a)).

## 11. Plan (PY1-PY11)

Estimates in working days, as the other surveys give them. Each milestone ends with its check green and its records.

| milestone | content | exit criteria | days |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **PY1** the spec and pins | `doc/python/SPEC.md`: Python forms for every `ast` node of 3.14 (§4), the literal spelling, `:full`'s tokens, the checklist against `Parser/Python.asdl`; pins (`tools/pydump/PYTHON_VERSION`, the tarball's sha256, the site-packages apks, `test/python/corpora.edn`); `Lib/test`'s counts measured; the samples | the spec accepted; every corpus pinned and counted | 2-3 |
| **PY2** repr/python `:lines` | `tools/pydump` (tree, error, symtable, code), `arbace.repr.python.convert`, `.print`, `bin/repr-python read|print|roundtrip|check` | stdlib, site-packages, `Lib/test`'s files read; levels 1-3 of §5.2; rejected files judged on the message; costs recorded | 4-6 |
| **PY3** `:full` | the token mode, comments and layout woven, levels 4-5 | byte for byte over every read corpus; `marshal` equal | 3-5 |
| **PY4** synthetic corpora and references | the generator of §8.3, `bin/pyi record-ref`, `test/python/ref-cpython314.edn`, `Lib/test`'s per-method references | references for the synthetic, the language-core modules and the benchmarks | 2-3 |
| **PY5** pyi's core | scope analysis checked against `symtable`; the compiler to the IR; the frame machine; the object model (§6.4) for the built-in types, classes, descriptors, exceptions, generators, coroutines, `match`, f-strings and t-strings, `with`; `builtins`, `sys`; the REPL | the synthetic corpus and the language-core modules of `Lib/test` passing or classed; `symtable` equal over every corpus | 15-25 |
| **PY6** the stdlib | `python/Lib/` vendored as forms (`bin/python-vendor`), the import system from `importlib._bootstrap`, the Go ports of §6.6, threads with the GIL, `asyncio` over `selectors` | `Lib/test`'s per-method check: none failing, every non-pass classed; `pyperformance`'s pure benchmarks run | 10-18 |
| **PY7** the check over `Lib/test` and the classes | `bin/pyi check`, `divergences`, controls (GTS81 (a)), the coverage subset and rotation slices (GT8), finalization's class measured (PYS9) | every case in a result or a class; the nightly within its share | 4-6 |
| **PY8** AOT | the IR → Go forms, generators as state machines, `bin/pyi check --aot`, pyi against compiled | none failing; every refusal with a reason; speed recorded | 8-14 |
| **PY9** the native reader | the lexer port, pegen ported to Arbace with an Arbace back end, the actions; `parse-check` with mutants; `_ast` and `_tokenize` in pyi on it | trees and errors equal to the helper's over every corpus and the mutants | 8-15 |
| **PY10** the row | `cells.edn` `:python`, classes files, `bin/reap`, essential subsets, steps (`:parts` per corpus), Makefile | `bin/reap`: Python's four cells checked, none failing; `bin/gate --costs` within the shares | 1-2 |
| **PY11** the milestone | `bin/gate --full --clean` with Python's steps within budget, the embedding and re-seed if decided (PYS18), the tag | the tag | 1-2 |

**Total: about 57 to 98 working days** (PY1 2-3, PY2 4-6, PY3 3-5, PY4 2-3, PY5 15-25, PY6 10-18, PY7 4-6, PY8 8-14,
PY9 8-15, PY10 1-2, PY11 1-2); without the native reader (PYS4 (c)) about 49 to 83. PY1-PY3 (9 to 14 days) are a
trial with no runtime commitment; PY9 can run beside PY5-PY8 (it needs only PY2's helper as its judge).

**Sonnet and Opus** (the user's split): Sonnet for PY1's spec from `Python.asdl`, the helper (a short Python
script), the converter and printer once the heads are fixed, PY3's token weaving, PY4's generator, PY6's vendoring
tool and the mechanical ports (`binascii`, `_struct`, `_random`, hashes), PY7's classing, PY10. Opus for the IR and
frame machine, the object model and its slots, generators and coroutines, exception groups, finalization, the GIL,
`_sre`, pegen's port, the AOT.

**Re-seed needs.** PY1-PY4 change tools' namespaces only (evaluated from the checkout, out of `gate_key`, as the
other crops' are). `go/arbace/py` is evaluated by goi until listed in goi's table and compiled; embedding pyi in the
shipped program waits for a re-seed batched with the other crops' (CS250's decided line).

## 12. Proposals (PYS1-PYS20)

Each with options, the recommended one first.

- **PYS1 The reference and its pins.**
  - Options: (a) CPython 3.14.10: the host's Alpine `python3-3.14.10-r1` as the oracle (the helper and the recorded
    runs; its apk's sha256 pinned in the style of `tools/rsdump/apks.sha256`), and the source tarball
    `Python-3.14.10.tar.xz` from python.org (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.14.10/`, sha256 pinned, to verify)
    for `Lib/test`, `Grammar/`, `Parser/`, `Tools/peg_generator/`, `Modules/` (references for ports) and `LICENSE`;
    the apk `python3-tests` not used (it is the same `Lib/test`, but a second artefact to pin); (b) the tarball alone,
    CPython built from it into `.tmp/` as the oracle (independent of Alpine's moves, a build of minutes per pin);
    (c) 3.13.x (the previous release; no t-strings, no PEP 758, the old annotations).
  - *Recommended: (a)*, the pattern of gcc and GHC (the host's compiler, its package pinned); (b) if Alpine edge
    moves to 3.15 before PY11.
- **PYS2 Names.**
  - Options: (a) `pyi` (`bin/pyi`), repr/python (`arbace.repr.python`, `bin/repr-python`), `tools/pydump`, the runtime
    `go/arbace/py`, the forms' top heads `python/...`, the vendored library `python/Lib/`, milestones PY1-PY11,
    proposals PYS (PYS20 onward after PY1); (b) `pi` (clashes with the constant); (c) `cpyi`.
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS3 The read level's oracle.**
  - Options: (a) the helper `tools/pydump` on the host's interpreter (`ast`, `tokenize`, `symtable`, `compile`), a
    script with no build; (b) the native reader first (PY9 before PY2: no judge on its first day, the helper still
    needed to judge it); (c) `python3 -m ast` and `-m tokenize`'s text scraped (lossy: no symtable, no code digests).
  - *Recommended: (a)*, as hsdump, rsdump and ocdump.
- **PYS4 The native reader.**
  - Options: (a) in the plan (PY9), generated from `python.gram` by an Arbace port of pegen with the C actions
    translated, the lexer hand-ported, beside PY5-PY8; (b) a hand-written recursive descent parser (no generator to
    port, but the `invalid_*` rules' messages rewritten by hand and kept in step at each release); (c) not in v1 (the
    host's CPython stays needed for read).
  - *Recommended: (a)*: the grammar is the specification CPython itself is generated from, so the messages and the
    release-to-release diffs come for free, and with it every level of the row is standalone.
- **PYS5 The forms' vocabulary.**
  - Options: (a) the `ast` classes as heads (§4), `ctx` dropped and checked, operators as symbols, literal spelling
    and implicit concatenation kept; (b) a desugared core (the IR) as the user-facing form (loses the round trip);
    (c) a concrete syntax tree (lib2to3's kind: every token a node; heavier, and `:full`'s tokens give the same).
  - *Recommended: (a)*, as OCaml's forms mirror the Parsetree.
- **PYS6 `:full`.**
  - Options: (a) the helper's token stream (E5) woven into the forms by position, comments and `NL` kept; (b) the
    source text's slices between nodes stored (simpler, but the forms then carry text rather than structure).
  - *Recommended: (a)*, the native lexer replacing the helper's tokens at PY9.
- **PYS7 Eval's representation.**
  - Options: (a) an IR of Arbace's own compiled from the forms, run by a frame machine on heap frames (§6.3);
    (b) a closure tree on Go's stack (goi's), generators by goroutine hand-off (OC6's); (c) CPython's bytecode from
    the oracle's `marshal` (version-locked, E7, and the oracle needed to run).
  - *Recommended: (a)*: generators, coroutines, tracebacks, `settrace` and `RecursionError` are frames.
- **PYS8 The runtime's base.**
  - Options: (a) `go/arbace/py`, hand-written Go forms (as `go/arbace/scm` and `go/arbace/oi`), objects as Go structs
    with a type pointer and slots; (b) Arbace's Clojure runtime values (persistent collections against Python's
    mutable ones: a mismatch at every operation); (c) Java forms over jrt, translated by j2g.
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS9 Finalization and reference counts.**
  - Options: (a) Go's tracing GC, `__del__` and weak-reference callbacks run from a finalizer queue drained at
    `gc.collect()` and at safe points, the timing a design class, measured at PY7; (b) reference counting
    emulated (an increment and decrement at every store, cycles left to Go's GC: CPython's timing exactly, at a
    cost of perhaps 1.5 to 2 times, to measure); (c) (a) with counting for the few types whose finalization is
    commonly relied on (files, generators' `close`), as a hybrid.
  - *Recommended: (a)*, then (c) or (b) on PY7's measured class.
- **PYS10 Threads.**
  - Options: (a) goroutines under a GIL with CPython's switch interval; (b) free-threaded semantics (3.14t: per-object
    locks, no GIL); (c) no threads in v1 (`threading` a class).
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS11 The standard library.**
  - Options: (a) the Python modules as forms with the pure twins in the C modules' places, and Go ports for the
    list of §6.6; (b) (a) plus the self-contained C cores (`sre_lib.h`, libmpdec, expat, mt19937) read as C forms and
    translated by cf2g with hand-written glue, where a port would be large; (c) every C module ported to Go.
  - *Recommended: (a)*, (b) studied at PY6 for `_sre` and `_decimal`'s speed.
- **PYS12 The import system.**
  - Options: (a) `importlib._bootstrap` and `_bootstrap_external` run as forms, frozen into the executable,
    source-only; (b) an import system written in Go (faster at start, a second implementation of PEP 302/451's rules).
  - *Recommended: (a)*, as Scheme's crop runs psyntax.
- **PYS13 AOT's path.**
  - Options: (a) the IR → Go forms over `go/arbace/py` (a compiled interpreter; Scheme's SC9 (a)); (b) the IR → Java
    forms → j2g (OCaml's OC7 (a)); (c) Python → Arbace's Clojure → c2j (a semantic mismatch at every operation).
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS14 The run judge.**
  - Options: (a) status, stdout byte for byte, stderr's last line, with addresses and `id()` masked, `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`
    and pyi's `siphash13` keyed as CPython keys it for seed 0 (E9); the full traceback a second judge where positions
    matter; (b) stdout only; (c) sets and dicts compared as sorted (hides real divergences).
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS15 `Lib/test`'s judge and `sys.implementation`.**
  - Options: (a) per test method from the runner's verbose output, `sys.implementation.name == "arbace"` so
    `@cpython_only` and `check_impl_detail()` tests skip (their skips counted as a design class), as PyPy runs it;
    (b) per module (coarse: one failing method hides the rest); (c) `sys.implementation.name == "cpython"` (internals'
    tests run and fail).
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS16 Corpora and GT8 from the start.**
  - Options: (a) the synthetic corpora (§8.3) and coverage subsets of `Lib/test` from PY4/PY7, the read corpora whole
    (minutes), costs recorded per level from the first record; (b) `Lib/test` whole nightly (hours: over the share);
    (c) the synthetic corpora alone (misses the stdlib's real use).
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS17 The site-packages and PyPI corpus.**
  - Options: (a) the host's `py3-*` apks for read and print at PY2 (pinned by version), a small pinned PyPI set of
    pure packages for eval later; (b) a PyPI set fetched and pinned at PY1; (c) none.
  - *Recommended: (a)*.
- **PYS18 Embedding.**
  - Options: (a) repr/python and pyi evaluated from the checkout, out of `gate_key`, until the row fits the budget,
    then embedded at a re-seed batched with the other crops'; (b) embedded from PY5.
  - *Recommended: (a)*, as the crops since CS250.
- **PYS19 The crop's place in the order.**
  - Options: (a) after the tag `arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1` and GT8's compressed corpora, PY1-PY3 (light: a script,
    a converter, a printer) any time beside Haskell's and Rust's eval surveys, PY5 onward when the night budget has
    room; (b) Python first among the unparked crops (its eval needs no semantic oracle: the shortest way to a
    standalone row); (c) after Haskell and Rust's rows.
  - *Recommended: (a)*; (b) if the user wants the next row soonest.
- **PYS20 Python at Arbace's REPL.**
  - Options: (a) later: a package `python` of Arbace's API to Python forms (as `go/arbace.ae` is Go's, GR5), Python
    objects and Arbace values crossing by explicit conversion; (b) in v1.
  - *Recommended: (a)*.

## 13. What to decide first

PYS1 (the pin and the tarball's fetch), PYS3 and PYS4 (the oracle, and whether the native reader is in v1), PYS7
(eval's representation), PYS9 (finalization), PYS11 (the stdlib's strategy), then PYS19 (when). The rest follow. A
cheap trial is PY1-PY3: a round trip at five levels with no runtime.

## 14. Risks

- **Breadth.** The object model and the builtins are wide and every corner is observable; `Lib/test` exercises them
  all. PY5's range (15-25) is the widest and is re-estimated after the synthetic corpus runs.
- **Finalization timing** (PYS9): code relying on prompt `__del__`, weak-reference callbacks and `ResourceWarning`
  is common in `Lib/test`; the class may be large under (a).
- **Hash order** (E9): set and dict-of-set outputs differ unless `siphash13`, its seed-0 key and CPython's table
  probing and resizing are reproduced exactly; a slip shows as many stdout diffs at once.
- **Speed**: an interpreter on Go may be several times slower than CPython 3.14's specializing interpreter; the
  nightly share then holds fewer test methods, and the subsets carry more of the weight.
- **CPython-specific tests**: `@cpython_only`, `_testcapi`, `gc`, `sys.getrefcount`, `dis` of CPython's bytecode,
  `test_ast`'s positions of CPython's optimizer: a large design class, to keep honest (each with its reason).
- **The C modules' tail**: `ctypes`, `sqlite3`, `ssl`, `lzma`, `bz2`, `curses` and the CJK codecs as classes; a
  program importing one is a class, not a failure.
- **Unicode and floats**: Unicode 16.0.0's tables (Go's own are another version, to verify), `float` repr and
  formatting by CPython's rules, `math` to the last bit (musl's libm through the C crop, or a class).
- **The f-string/t-string lexer** (PY9): PEP 701's nested modes are the hardest part of a native lexer; until PY9
  the helper's tokens carry `:full`.
- **Moving pins**: Alpine edge may move to 3.15 (October 2026's 3.15 alpha cycle, to verify) and drop 3.14's apk;
  the apk's sha pinned and PYS1 (b) as the fallback.
- **Estimates**: the plan's ranges follow goi's, oi's and si's experience; unmeasured inputs (`Lib/test`'s size, the
  share of its methods pyi can run, the slowdown factor) are measured at PY1, PY5 and PY7 and the plan re-estimated.

## Appendix A: the scratch

In the worktree `.tmp/worktrees/python-survey`, `.tmp/python/` (gitignored): `t.py` (E4, E6, E7: a module with a
comment, `0x1F`, an f-string, a t-string, a generic function, `match`, PEP 758's `except`, `type`, a lambda with
`yield`), `u.py` (E4's UTF-8 offsets, E5's round trip), `sy.py` (a `nonlocal` for `symtable`). The probes were
one-line `python3 -c` programs over these and over `/usr/lib/python3.14/` (E2, E5, E8), each under a few seconds.

## Decided (2026-11-03, the user): PYS1-PYS20

PYS1-PYS18 and PYS20 all (a), as recommended. PYS19: the Mac VM peer does all of Python, step by step (PY1 through
PY11, a standing line of queue tasks, each reviewed and merged on the main host), beginning now, beside GT8; the main host
keeps GT8, the tag `arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1` and the other crops. Python stays out of `gate_key` and the gate (PYS18)
until its row fits GT8's budget.

## As built: PY1 (2026-11-03, the Mac VM, queue 174)

- **The spec**, `doc/python/SPEC.md`: Python forms for every node of `Parser/Python.asdl` (3.14.10: 19 types, 113
  constructors, 196 fields, 8 types with position attributes), the literals' spellings (§3: numbers, string and bytes
  bodies as written with `:prefix` and `:quote`, `str-concat` for implicit concatenation, f-strings with `:debug` for
  `=`, t-strings), `elif` kept, positions and `:full`'s tokens (§11), the error form (§12), the checklist (§13) and the
  choices S1-S20 (§14). The operators the reader cannot read (`@`, `//`, `^`, `~`) take the Go and C forms' names
  (S1). `ast.parse(type_comments=True)` rejects one file of `Lib/test` the plain parse accepts, so type comments come
  from a second parse (S6).
- **The pins**: the oracle in `tools/pydump/PYTHON_VERSION` (version, `sys.version`, the apk and its APKINDEX
  checksum per architecture); the tarball in `test/python/corpora.edn` (SHA-256 checked against python.org's
  published value and its Sigstore bundle's digest, SHA-512 against Alpine's APKBUILD), with five of its reference
  files; the site-packages set as 20 Alpine apks fetched into `.tmp/` (not installed), pinned per architecture in
  `tools/pydump/apks.sha256`, their `.py` files identical on x86_64 and aarch64.
- **The corpora** (`test/python/corpora.edn`): `stdlib` (`Lib/` less `Lib/test`: 720 files, 335,637 lines),
  `lib-test` (1,153 `.py` files, 667,670 lines; 433 test modules, 3,468 classes with 31,427 test methods counted
  statically; 4 files `ast.parse` rejects, 1 more that only `type_comments=True` rejects), `language-core` (the 11
  modules of §8.2: 28,302 lines, 1,140 test methods), `site-packages` (921 files, 330,603 lines), `samples` (6 files,
  every node class of the `ast` covered).
- **The checks**, `bin/repr-python pins --fetch|--count|--check`, `spec-check`, `samples` (the Makefile's
  `repr-python-*`), light, out of `gate_key` and the gate (PYS18).

## As built: PY2 (2026-11-03, the Mac VM, queue 175)

- **The helper** `tools/pydump/pydump.py` (no build; run `python3 -I -S -B`): `tree` writes each file as Python forms in
  the spec's vocabulary (the literals' spellings scanned in the source and evaluated back to their values; a target's
  context marked for the converter), or `(python/error ...)`, with a TSV per file of the levels' digests (`ast.dump`;
  the code without positions) and its seconds and peak RSS; `symtable` (PY5's reference) and `code`. Type comments
  from a second parse, a file only `type_comments=True` rejects marked `:type-comments :rejected` (queue 174's
  DECISION (a), provisional pending the user).
- **The converter and the printer**, `arbace.repr.python.convert` and `.print`, and the command `arbace.repr.python`
  (`convert`, `print`, `compare`), evaluated on stage 0 from the checkout (`ARBACE_PATH`; not embedded and out of the
  keys: `arbace/j2g/embed.ae`, `bin/lib/version.bash`, the audit's hosts, PYS18 (a)).
- **The round trip** `bin/repr-python roundtrip [--record]` (and `read`, `print`, `check`): levels 1-3 of §5.2 over
  samples, stdlib, site-packages (the 20 pinned apks, queue 174's DECISION (a), provisional) and `Lib/test`, judged
  against `test/python/roundtrip-known.edn` (two classes, both by rule: `:rejected`, the 4 files CPython rejects,
  judged on its message; `:code-lines`, the code differing with the ast equal: the positions'). On the VM (aarch64, 8
  CPUs), 2,800 files: level 1 2,796 of 2,796 read, level 2 all, level 3 all but 30 (3 stdlib, 21 site-packages, 6
  `Lib/test`); about 4.5 minutes, the costs per corpus and stage in `test/python/roundtrip-costs.edn`.
- **E7 corrected**: CPython 3.14's code without positions is not independent of the lines: a class body stores
  `__firstlineno__`, the compiler fuses `STORE_FAST`/`LOAD_FAST` pairs only within a line, inserts `NOP`s by line and
  splits exception ranges and match statements' `SWAP`s by line; the level's digest normalizes the first ones
  (`code_digest`), the rest are `:code-lines`.
