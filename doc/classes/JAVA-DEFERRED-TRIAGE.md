# Java's deferred cases, triaged by root cause (2026-11-05)

The REAP matrix's Java cells at `next` (`d86cb874a`, `test/reap/matrix.edn`): **eval 1,848 pass / 254 by
design / 1,220 deferred**, **AOT 1,921 / 160 / 1,241** (doc/FULL-SUPPORT-SURVEY.md, "REAP v3's divergences").
This triage asks what the 1,220 and 1,241 deferred tests really wait for, groups them by that root cause
rather than by the class `test/java/divergences.edn` files them under, and ranks the fixes by tests
regained per day of work. Nothing was run but the analysis of the committed records and sources (no build,
no corpus run). AGENDA item 4 of 2026-11-05; doc/classes/JAVA-CONFORMANCE-SURVEY.md (JC1-JC8, JCS1-JCS127)
is the background, and its JCS90-JCS99 ("the world decided") are the decisions this plan refines.

## Summary

- The divergence classes name the **first regex that matched a failure's message**, not its cause: `:security`
  (361 interpreted) is 198 tests of `javax.crypto` and key factories, 120 of certificates and keystores, 44 of
  JAAS, 34 of permissions; `:net` (233) holds 51 tests that stop at `FileInputStream.getChannel`; the compiled
  level's largest class, `:j2g-unresolved` (305), is not a translation problem at all: it is crypto 73, PKI 45,
  TLS 38, javac's API 31, the class-file API 26, ... (j2g refuses the test at the first unresolved type).
- Read by root cause, **one fix stands out: the JCA** (javax.crypto, SunJCE's ciphers, RSA, DSA and EC key
  factories and signatures, the key specs). It is the only thing missing for **176 interpreted and 168
  compiled tests**, about 7 days: 49 tests a day, twice the rate of anything after the first five.
- The **first five fixes** (JCA, java.util.logging, permissions with JAAS's core, PKI, the JCS96 small-members
  batch), **20.5 days**, unblock at most **404 interpreted and 386 compiled** tests; the **first eight**
  (adding charsets' coders, FileChannel, datagrams), **32.5 days**, at most **564 / 549**. With the record's
  calibration (below: about 70% of a test unblocked by the class scan passes once its classes exist), expect
  about **280-390** of the eight's 564 at eval: eval from 1,848 to about **2,130-2,240**, AOT from 1,921 to
  about **2,190-2,300**.
- Every fix built (24 of them, about 123 days) would leave **101 interpreted and 173 compiled** deferred tests,
  all of them needing something decided or proposed by design (JMX, the class-file API, serialization, XML,
  RMI, class loading) or the harness's own classes.
- **Reclassifications with no work** (Proposed, JCS128-JCS130): 36 interpreted and 108 compiled deferred tests
  also need a by-design feature (serialization 48 compiled, the class-file API 25/29, XML 21 compiled, ...) and
  can never pass; 18 and 18 need only JMX, which JCS95 (a) decided by design but `:management` still files as
  `:world`; 17 and 17 are the harness's (no JVM launcher, identity hash codes, clocks, thread order, no heap
  ceiling). Applying JCS128-JCS130 moves up to **71 interpreted and 143 compiled** tests from deferred to by
  design (or to pass, for the status-only ones), before any fix.

## 1. Method

**The classification, reproduced.** A Python copy of `test/reap/main.ae`'s `classify` (the first class of
`test/java/divergences.edn` that applies at the level, its `:results`, `:tests` or a `:match` regex finding
"RESULT REASON"; the `:kind-map` of `test/reap/cells.edn`) over `test/java/check-interp.edn` and
`check-compiled.edn` gives the matrix's numbers exactly: interp 1,848 / 254 / 1,220, compiled 1,921 / 160 /
1,241.

**The world.** The classes the executables have: every `ClassInfo :Name` of the gate's executable's
translated `jrt` package (`.tmp/gate-exe/3157cb94cd9b233a7208/amd64/j2g/gen/go/arbace/jrt`, the build of
`d86cb874a`) and of jrt's hand-written Go (`go/arbace/jrt/*.ae`): **2,637 classes**, and 240 more that exist
only as cut stubs (`j2g_cut.ae`: a type, no members).

**The static scan.** For each test, its source set (`test/java/ref-jdk26.edn`'s `:files`, read in place at
`/root/jdk26u/test/`, comments and strings removed): the JDK classes it names, by its imports (single and
on-demand), its fully qualified names, and `java.lang`'s and its on-demand packages' simple names that are
JDK classes (an index of jdk26u's `src/*/share|unix/classes` plus the world, 13,347 classes), less the classes
the test declares. A named class not in the world is **missing**. The scan is sound on the passing tests: of
the 1,848 that pass interpreted, one names a missing class (`java.lang.SafeVarargs`, an annotation; the
annotations are ignored).

**The reasons.** Each recorded non-pass names what it stopped at: `ClassNotFoundException: C`, `Unable to
resolve symbol: S (the import C)`, `Unknown type: S (the import C)`, `class C is not in the closed world`,
`No accessible method m in C`, `jrt lacks C.m(...)`, `C.m is not in the Go build`. Those name classes the scan
already has, and **members** the scan cannot see (`FileInputStream.getChannel`, `Charset.newDecoder`,
`Class.getAnnotation`, `URLEncoder.encode`, `NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces`, `Provider.<init>`...).

**The causes.** Every missing class and member maps to one **root cause** (a cluster: one fix's scope;
`cluster()` in the scripts, by package and class, members by name). A test's causes are the union of its
scan's and its reason's; a test whose failure names no class or member (a wrong output, an exception of the
test's own, a timeout) keeps its divergence class as its cause (`class:jrt-dates`, `class:speed-hang`, ...).
A test needing several causes is counted under each. The columns below:

- **touches**: the deferred tests one of whose causes it is;
- **alone**: the tests it is the only cause of: unblocked if it alone were fixed;
- **+deps**: the tests unblocked by it with its prerequisites (PKI after the JCA, TLS after both);
- **design**: the tests it touches that also need a by-design feature (never regained).

**Calibration.** "Unblocked" means every class the test names exists; it can still fail on a member, a
behaviour or the time limit. Two measures of how far that holds: of the tests whose scan finds nothing
missing today, 83% pass interpreted and 86% compiled (the rest are the behaviour classes); JC6b, the last
widening of the world (java.io and zip, doc/classes/JAVA-CONFORMANCE-SURVEY.md, "As built: JC6b"), regained 57
of `:io`'s 110 and 45 of `:zip`'s 68 tests, counted by touches, not by cause. This plan uses **0.7 × alone**
as the expected yield of a new area of the world, and the alone and +deps counts as upper bounds.

**Reproducing.** The scripts and their outputs are scratch, in this worktree's `.tmp/triage/` (to be copied
before the worktree is removed): `edn.py` (a reader for the Clojure data), `classify.py` (the matrix's
classification: `rows.json`), `scan.py` (the static scan: `scan.json`; inputs `jdk-classes.txt`, the
worktree's `.tmp/world-classes.txt`, `.tmp/cut-classes.txt`), `causes.py` (the causes: `causes.json`,
`tables.txt`), `plan.py` (the fixes, the greedy ranking: `plan.txt`), `classtab.txt` (§2's table).

## 2. The divergence classes, read by cause

Deferred tests per class (interp, compiled), with the causes found in them (a test counted under each of its
causes; "design-blocked": also needs a by-design feature).

## 3. Root causes

Interp / compiled in each cell. Days are one agent's, including the converter run (`bin/jrt-convert update`),
the edge (`bin/j2g-edge update`), the build and the corpus's area rerun; risk is that the estimate or the
yield is wrong.

## 4. The ranked plan

Greedy by tests per day, each step taking its prerequisites; the gains are the deferred tests the step
unblocks (upper bounds, interp / compiled), the expected yield about 0.7 of them.

| # | fix | days | gain | tests/day | cumulative | at day |

| 24 | F22 speed | 15+ | 28 / 8 | 2.4 | 1,119 / 1,068 | 123 |

Left after all 24: 101 / 173, each needing JMX (34 / 37), the class-file API (25 / 29), serialization (1 /
48), XML (2 / 21), RMI (11 / 15), class loading, JDI, smartcardio, FFM or the harness. Steps 1-4 are one
area, the security half of JCS90 (16.5 days for up to 341 / 332), and TLS (step 10) closes it; the curve is
flat from step 5 to step 15 (17-29 tests a day), so their order there can follow other needs (F7 and F10 are
one NIO thread; F6 is a check change, not the world). F14, F15 and F22 are design work of their own (R16's
reversal, MethodHandles, the interpreter's speed) at a third of the rate.

**What the plan does not count.** Each widening also makes the read and print levels' tests of those areas
run (unchanged) and will surface the tests' second causes (a member, a behaviour): expect each area's rerun
to leave a tail in new, narrower classes, as JC6b's did.

## 5. The top fixes, designed

All the world fixes are one shape, the way JC6b added java.io and zip: jdk26u's own Java into the closure
(`test/jrt/jrt_sources.ae`: a new `def` of paths and its line in `sources`; a module other than java.base in
`added-module-sources`), jrt's own Java in `overlay/jdk/java.base` where jdk26u's needs what is cut, variants
in `overlay/jdk/variants/` for single members, then `bin/jrt-convert update` (javac's tool, heavy), `bin/j2g-edge
update`, the executables built, the area's tests run interpreted and compiled (`bin/java-check --levels
interp,compiled --only ...`), their records and classes updated, `bin/reap --record`. Judged by the area's
tests regained at both levels against this triage's alone and +deps counts, with no passing test lost
(`levels-known.edn`, the essential gate), and `bin/jrt-convert verify` byte for byte.

### F1 The JCA (7 days, 176 / 168 alone)

- **Scope.** javax.crypto (38 files, 14.5k lines: Cipher, CipherSpi, the cipher streams, KeyGenerator,
  SecretKeyFactory, KeyAgreement, KDF, SealedObject, EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo, NullCipher, the exceptions;
  `spec/` 19, `interfaces/` 5); `com/sun/crypto/provider` (100 files, 33.7k: AES, DES, DESede, Blowfish,
  RC2, ARCFOUR, ChaCha20, the modes (CBC, CTR, GCM, ...), padding, PBE, PBKDF2, DH, the key wrap); the
  java.security engines and SPIs still missing (KeyFactory, KeyPairGenerator, KeyPair, Signature,
  AlgorithmParameterGenerator, AlgorithmParametersSpi, the key interfaces), `java/security/spec` (36 files)
  and `interfaces` (20); `sun/security/rsa` (14: RSA keys, signatures, PSS, OAEP padding),
  `sun/security/provider`'s DSA and its key classes, `sun/security/ec` (17 plus `point/` 6, and the field
  arithmetic jdk26u's build generates, `IntegerPolynomialP256` and kin: a `gensrc` entry, made by
  `bin/jrt-convert`'s generate step with the build's `FieldGen`, as the CLDR data is), the DER and OID
  utilities of `sun/security/util` (DerValue, DerInputStream, DerOutputStream, ObjectIdentifier, KnownOIDs
  are there already) and `sun/security/x509`'s AlgorithmId and X509Key (the key encodings need them; the rest
  of x509 is F2's). About 85k lines, +18% on the closure's 460k.
- **What is cut today and must change.** The provider registry is jrt's own: `overlay/jdk/variants/SunJCE.ae`
  and `SunEntries`' variant register only the services the build implements, and
  `overlay/jdk/java.base/com/sun/crypto/provider/JceServices.java` and `sun/security/provider/JrtServices.java`
  construct them by name (no class loading). F1 extends the three to SunJCE's, SUN's and SunRsaSign's and
  SunEC's full service lists, `ProviderConfig`'s variant making SunRsaSign and SunEC directly beside SUN and
  SunJCE. `JceSecurity` (overlay, from its template) keeps the unlimited policy. DESKey, DESedeKey, PBEKey,
  PBKDF2KeyImpl and GaloisCounterMode register a Cleaner to zero key bytes: variants without it (as ZipFile's,
  JC6b) until F17. ChaCha20, GHASH, GaloisCounterMode use `MethodHandles.byteArrayViewVarHandle`, which j2g
  already compiles directly (ByteArrayAccess, SHA3 are in the closure). Provider's protected constructor
  (`:interp-protected`'s 6 crypto tests, the interpreted subclasses of Provider) needs Provider among the
  extendable classes (`arbace.j2g.model/class-supers`), with Cipher, CipherSpi and Mac (JC4b's mechanism).
- **Risks.** j2g's and repr/java's first contact with 85k lines (JC6b's 10k found 4 j2g findings); EC's
  generated sources; the interpreted KAT loops' speed (the providers are compiled, the tests' loops
  interpreted: some of `com/sun/crypto/provider`'s may join `:speed`); the executable's size (JCS135).
- **Judged by** `jdk/com/sun/crypto`, `jdk/javax/crypto`, `jdk/sun/security/{rsa,ec,provider}`,
  `jdk/java/security/{KeyFactory,KeyPairGenerator,Signature,spec,Provider}` interpreted and compiled: 176 / 168
  alone at most, about 120 expected.

### F5 java.util.logging (1.5 days, 27 / 26)

- **Scope.** java.logging's 19 files (9.9k lines) and `sun/util/logging/internal/LoggingProviderImpl`, an
  `added-module-sources` entry; `conf/logging.properties` into `jdk/data` (as `java.security` is,
  `bin/jrt-convert`'s data step); `System.getLogger`'s LoggerFinder bound to it directly (no ServiceLoader).
- **Cut.** `LogRecord.inferCaller` walks the stack with StackWalker (absent until F20): a variant that walks
  `Throwable.getStackTrace` (jrt's frames), or answers no caller; LogManager's handler classes named in the
  configuration made by a table of the closure's handlers (no class loading by name); `LoggingMXBean` and
  `MemoryHandler`'s management parts left out (F13).
- **Judged by** `jdk/java/util/logging` (26 of the 27 alone).

### F4 Permissions and JAAS's core (3 days, 49 / 45)

- **Scope.** java.security's permission classes (BasicPermission, Permissions, PermissionCollection,
  AllPermission, SecurityPermission, UnresolvedPermission, the cut `Permission` made whole), AccessController
  and AccessControlContext (since JDK 24 they only run the action: no SecurityManager), Policy, ProtectionDomain,
  CodeSource, DomainCombiner, PrivilegedActionException; java.io.FilePermission, java.net.SocketPermission,
  NetPermission, java.util.PropertyPermission, RuntimePermission's members, ReflectPermission;
  javax.security.auth's Subject, PrivateCredentialPermission, AuthPermission, `callback/` (11), `login/` (14),
  `com.sun.security.auth`'s principals and TextCallbackHandler. All plain Java, about 15k lines.
- **Cut.** `Class.getProtectionDomain` (one test) answers a fixed domain; the login modules that reach JNDI or
  Kerberos stay out (F19, F4b).
- **Judged by** `jdk/javax/security/auth`, `jdk/com/sun/security/auth`, `jdk/java/security/BasicPermission`,
  `jdk/java/io/FilePermission`, `jdk/java/net/SocketPermission`.

### F2 PKI (5 days after F1, 89 / 89 with F1)

- **Scope.** `java/security/cert` (51 files), `sun/security/x509` (72), `sun/security/pkcs` (10) and `pkcs12`
  (3), `sun/security/provider/certpath` (37: PKIX validation and building, without the OCSP and LDAP fetchers'
  network paths), KeyStore and its SPI with the JKS, PKCS12 and DKS implementations, X500Principal,
  `sun/security/provider/X509Factory`, `JarEntry.getCertificates` and JarVerifier verifying for real (jrt's
  verifies nothing, JC6b). About 55k lines.
- **Cut.** The cacerts keystore: `lib/security/cacerts` into `jdk/data` from jdk26u's build (as `tzdb.dat`),
  or an empty one (the tests that read it are few); revocation checking's network fetches fail as offline.
- **Judged by** `jdk/java/security/cert`, `jdk/java/security/KeyStore`, `jdk/sun/security/{x509,pkcs,pkcs12}`,
  the signed-jar tests of `jdk/java/util/jar` (`:security`'s t05737, t05742).

### F16 The small members (4 days, 63 / 54)

JCS96 (c)'s batch, which the user deferred (b) on 2026-10-26: Timer and TimerTask (two files), ThreadGroup's
members over jrt's threads, `Thread.ofPlatform`, `getAllStackTraces`, `activeCount`, the
Atomic*FieldUpdaters (over the member tables' fields: the j2g side is reflection by name, as Field.get), FutureTask's
protected `set`, `done`, `runAndReset` (an extendable class's protected members, JC4b), ForkJoinPool's
`schedule` and `getStealCount`, ScopedValue, Scanner, PropertyResourceBundle, RandomGeneratorFactory with a
static list of the algorithms (no ServiceLoader), `java.version`, `java.vm.specification.vendor`,
`java.runtime.version` and Runtime.Version, String.transform, StringBuffer's capacity and an append's bounds,
FileInputStream.skip(-n), Math.pow's last place (StrictMath's fdlibm for Math.pow), javax.sql.rowset.serial's
SerialBlob and SerialClob, Bidi's ICU data. Each a class of jdk26u's or a member of jrt's; judged by the
classes `:threads`, `:util-classes`, `:random`, `:system-properties`, `:jrt-strings`, `:jrt-io`,
`:jrt-math`, `:sql`, `:text-data`.

### F8 Charsets (4 days, 58 / 56)

- **Scope.** jrt's charsets are its own (three plus three, J2G-SPEC §12): CharsetEncoder, CharsetDecoder,
  CoderResult and CodingErrorAction public as jdk26u's (they are cut: `newDecoder`, `newEncoder`, `encode`,
  `decode` and `availableCharsets` are missing members), jdk26u's `sun.nio.cs` coders for UTF-16 (BE, LE,
  with the BOM), UTF-32, the ISO-8859 family, KOI8 and the Windows code pages (table driven, generated by the
  build's `charsetmapping` tool from `make/data/charsetmapping`: a `gensrc` entry), then jdk.charsets' EUC,
  Big5, GB18030 and JIS tables (the same tool), with their aliases; the streams' coding (`no stream coding
  for UTF-16`) through the coders.
- **Risk.** The generated tables' size (jdk.charsets is about 3 MB of source); the order: the Unicode coders
  and the coders' API first (most of `jdk/java/nio/charset`), jdk.charsets second (most of `jdk/sun/nio/cs`,
  34 tests).
- **Judged by** `jdk/sun/nio/cs`, `jdk/java/nio/charset`, `:charsets-locales`.

### F7 File channels and buffers (5 days, 62 / 66)

- **Scope.** jrt's FileChannel exists, cut (no `close`, `isOpen`, `lock`, `map`, `transferTo`): its members
  over jrt's file table (RandomAccessFile's natives, JC6b), `getChannel` of FileInputStream, FileOutputStream
  and RandomAccessFile (24 tests stop there at either level), FileLock (Go's `syscall.Flock`/`fcntl`),
  FileChannel.MapMode with `map` as a heap copy written back on `force` and at unmap (MappedByteBuffer: no
  mmap in the sandbox's model; READ_ONLY maps exact), Channels' stream adapters, the channel exceptions;
  java.nio's buffer views jrt lacks (LongBuffer, ShortBuffer, Float/DoubleBuffer whole, the read-only heap
  buffers HeapByteBufferR/HeapCharBufferR, BufferMismatch), `allocateDirect` as a heap buffer (`isDirect`
  true).
- **Risk.** `map`'s semantics for tests that expect two maps of a file to share; those stay in a class.
- **Judged by** `jdk/java/nio/channels/FileChannel`, `jdk/java/nio/MappedByteBuffer`, `jdk/java/nio/Buffer`,
  `jdk/java/io/{FileDescriptor,FileInputStream,RandomAccessFile}`.

### F11 Datagrams (3 days, 38 / 38)

DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket over Go's `net.UDPConn` (jrt's sockets are TCP), MulticastSocket over
`net.ListenMulticastUDP` with the joins, NetworkInterface over `net.Interfaces` (`getNetworkInterfaces`,
`networkInterfaces`, addresses, flags), PortUnreachableException, StandardProtocolFamily. The tests mostly use
the loopback; those needing a multicast route fail in the check's sandbox the same on the JDK (they pass there:
the JDK's host has one), so a few will stay, in `:environment`. Judged by `jdk/java/net/{DatagramSocket,
DatagramPacket,MulticastSocket,NetworkInterface}`.

## 6. Findings on the way

- `:j2g-unresolved` (305 compiled, kind `:world`) is the compiled level's catch-all for "a type the world does
  not have": its tests are the world areas' (crypto, PKI, TLS, ...), 53 of them design-blocked. Since JCS44 (a)
  j2g's refusal names the import; the analysis' `Cannot convert ... of type :null` does not. Proposed: JCS44's
  naming extended to that message (j2g: the unresolved class in the refusal), so these tests fall in their
  areas' classes as the interpreted level's do.
- The interpreted `:javac-api` tests half need the class-file API too (20 of 39): running them on
  `arbace-javac` (F6) regains about 21, not 39.
- `:interp-protected`'s 19 interpreted tests are mostly not the interpreter's: 6 subclass Provider (F1), 3 a
  ClassLoader (by design), the rest single members (F16, F21).
- `:repl-sibling` (9) holds 4 SASL tests whose package order the REPL could not resolve; with SASL out
  (JCS133) they are by design.
- JCS99 (c) (the harness's tests' digests recorded as `"-"`) was decided on 2026-10-26 but the reference has
  not been recorded since (`--record-ref` needs the system's JDK): `:clock`, `:identity-sum` and the identity
  hash code tests still differ.

## Proposed

### JCS128 `:management` split as JCS95 decided

JCS95 (a) put JMX (`javax.management`) by design and left java.lang.management's MXBeans deferred (b); the class
`:management` still files both as `:world`. 34 interpreted and 37 compiled deferred tests name JMX, 18 and 18
only JMX.
- (a) Split: `:jmx` (`:kind :design`, `javax\.management`) before `:mxbeans` (`:world`,
  `java\.lang\.management|com\.sun\.management`). Cost: an hour, `bin/reap --record`. 18 / 18 move to by design.
- (b) Leave it until F13 is built.
- *Recommended: (a)*: it applies a decision already taken, and the matrix should say what was decided.

### JCS129 A deferred test that also needs a by-design feature is by design

36 interpreted and 108 compiled deferred tests name, beside their filed cause, a feature J2G-SPEC §12 or JCS95
(a)/JCS97 (a) put out for good: serialization (48 compiled: j2g refuses at an earlier unresolved type), the
class-file API (25 / 29), XML (2 / 21), class loading (8 / 5), JDI, smartcardio, FFM. No fix regains them.
- (a) A generated `:design` class, `:design-also`, listing them by `:tests`, made by the static scan (a script of
  `bin/java-check`'s, rerun when the corpus or the world changes), placed before the world classes. Cost: 1 day
  (the scan as Arbace code, `test/java/check.ae`, rather than this triage's Python). Moves 36 / 108.
- (b) The same by hand-curated `:tests` once (half a day), stale as the world grows.
- (c) Leave them deferred: the matrix overstates the deferred work by 3% / 9%.
- *Recommended: (a)*: the compiled level's 108 are the largest single correction, and the scan is cheap to keep.

### JCS130 The harness's classes out of the deferred count

17 interpreted and 17 compiled tests are the runner's: no JVM launcher (`:jvm-tools` 3), no heap ceiling
(`:memory-limit` 4), identity hash codes and their sums (`:identity` 3, `:identity-sum` 1), a run's clock
(`:clock` 1), the temporary directory (`:environment` 1), thread order (`:thread-order` 2,
`:interp-synchronized` 1), `:flaky`, `:read-failed`.
- (a) Apply JCS99 (c) at the next `--record-ref` (status only for `:identity*`, `:clock`, `:thread-order`,
  `:interp-synchronized`: they then pass), and map `:jvm-tools`, `:memory-limit` and `:environment` to by design in
  `test/reap/cells.edn`'s `:kind-map` (a `:kind :harness-design`, or those three `:kind :design`). Cost: half a day
  and the JDK's rerun of those tests. 
- (b) Only the kind-map: 17 / 17 to by design, none to pass.
- (c) Leave them.
- *Recommended: (a)*.

### JCS131 TLS: SunJSSE translated, not javax.net.ssl over Go's crypto/tls

JCS90 (b) planned javax.net.ssl "over Go's crypto/tls" after the providers. With F1 and F2 built, jdk26u's own
TLS (`sun/security/ssl`, 138 files, 63k lines, and javax.net.ssl's 42) is plain Java over the JCA, PKI and
sockets, which the world would then have.
- (a) Translate SunJSSE (8 days after F1, F2): the JDK's behaviour exactly (SSLEngine's states, the handshake
  messages, cipher suite order, the properties the tests set), up to 94 / 94 tests with F1-F2. Cost: +16% closure,
  SSLLogger's and the handshake's Cleaner/StackWalker uses as variants; QUIC's engine left out.
- (b) javax.net.ssl over crypto/tls (6-10 days, JCS90's): smaller, but SSLEngine's buffer API over a stream library
  is a design of its own, and the tests (javax/net/ssl, sun/security/ssl: handshake details) judge the JDK's
  implementation, which (b) would not have; jrt's own HTTPS client keeps crypto/tls either way.
- *Recommended: (a)*.

### JCS132 RMI by design

RMI's tests (11 interpreted, 15 compiled; 9 and 12 alone) marshal by serialization, which is by design
(J2G-SPEC §12), and register stubs by class loading.
- (a) By design, beside serialization: J2G-SPEC §12 amended, `java\.rmi` a `:design` class. Moves 9 / 12.
- (b) Deferred as now.
- *Recommended: (a)*.

### JCS133 Kerberos and GSS-API by design, SASL deferred

`sun/security/krb5`, `jgss` and `javax.security.auth.kerberos` need a KDC and keytabs the sandbox has not; the
SASL mechanisms (DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, NTLM) are plain Java over the JCA.
- (a) Kerberos and GSS-API by design; SASL deferred, after F1 and F4 (2 days).
- (b) All deferred (F4b, 6 days).
- *Recommended: (a)*.

### JCS134 The first wave: JC9, the world's security half and its cheap neighbours

- (a) A milestone JC9 of F1, F5, F4, F2 (16.5 days, up to 341 / 332 tests, about 240 / 230 expected), in that
  order, each its own branch and gate; then F16, F8, F7, F11 as JC9b (16 days, up to 223 / 217 more).
- (b) Smaller first: F5, F4, F16 (8.5 days, up to 139 / 129), the JCA after.
- (c) No widening before the next REAP tag; the reclassifications (JCS128-JCS130, JCS132) alone.
- *Recommended: (a)*, with JCS128-JCS130 applied first (they change the denominator, not the work).

### JCS135 The closure's growth

F1-F3 add about 210k Java lines (+45%) to the shipped executable's closure; all eight first fixes about 250k.
The REPL needs every class at hand (the interpreter calls the world by reflection), so they ship.
- (a) Ship them, measure the executable's size and the gate's build time at each step (JC6b's 10k lines cost
  nothing measurable; 210k may cost a minute of j2g and 30-60 MB).
- (b) A security tier: the JCA, PKI and TLS translated into the shipped executable only when a build option or
  a program (`--build-program`) asks for them; the check's executables with it.
- *Recommended: (a)*, revisited if the build grows past a minute.
