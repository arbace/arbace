# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

## 2026-10-06: Repository bootstrap

- The repo started from GitHub's profile-README template (`arbace/arbace`). Its `.gitignore` is
  GitHub's Leiningen template.
- Added `.claude/` (local Claude Code settings) and `.tmp/` (scratch space for temporaries) to
  `.gitignore`. Both patterns are unanchored. Created `.tmp/`.
- Defined the project: Arbace is a from-scratch reimplementation of Clojure in Clojure. Studying and
  vendoring prior art is always allowed. The work is a derivation done once by hand, and this journal
  exists so it could be repeated.
- Prior art:
  - https://github.com/clojure/clojure for the language.
  - https://github.com/openjdk/jdk26u for the native runtime.
  - https://github.com/golang/go as a slimmer, appealing runtime and anything else useful from
    it, except the Go language itself.
- Replaced the template README.md. Added CLAUDE.md, doc/AGENDA.md (the current state, rewritten
  freely) and doc/JOURNAL.md (this file, append-only).
