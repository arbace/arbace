# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

This journal starts over after the milestone `arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`, by the user's
decision (2026-10-20). It started over the same way at the two freezes and after the milestone
`arbace-inside-itself-v1`. The history before it is on the frozen branches, at two tags, and in
git history:

- 2026-10-06 to 2026-10-08 (the class forms, j2c, the vendored and self-hosting Clojure, the work
  for Java 26, the g2c survey): on
  [`arbace-for-java-26`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-java-26/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-java-26-v1`;
- 2026-10-08 to 2026-10-11 (milestone B1a: g2c, c2g, jrt, the evaluator, the Go executable and
  its feature completion, the freeze of the Go build): on
  [`arbace-for-golang`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-golang/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-go1.27.1-v1`;
- 2026-10-11 to 2026-10-15 (the `.ae` sources, c2a, B1b the box and its milestones
  `arbace-box-amd64-v1`, `arbace-box-arm64-v1`; the standalone Arbace S1-S8 and the milestones
  `arbace-seed-is-go-v1`, `arbace-inside-itself-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-inside-itself-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-inside-itself-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `e0ad476`);
- 2026-10-15 to 2026-10-20 (S9, Go's toolchain as forms; the docs' audit; the build's speed; the
  renames to repr/java, repr/go, repr/clojure, c2j and j2g; Futamura's F2-F7; repr/java print;
  repr/haskell R1-R6 and HR25; repr/rust RR1-RR6; goi GR0-GR10, the arm64 box check, GC81, and
  the milestone `arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `965cbed3`).

## 2026-10-20: the journal starts over

- **The user's decision**, after the milestone `arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1` (a tag on main, not
  a freeze, so no branch): this journal starts over.
  - The earlier one, 2,204 lines and 95 entries from 2026-10-15 to the tag's entry, is at the tag
    (linked above).
  - CLAUDE.md's Records paragraph, the agenda's header and README's documentation list now name the
    four places of the history.
- **The user cleared the goal** of 2026-10-19 ("reach arbace-interprets-go-v1, that is the next
  milestone"): the milestone is reached and tagged.
- **Still running at the reset:** goi's check in the emulated arm64 box over all of
  `test/goi/box.txt` (`GOI_BOX_ALL=1`, 584 programs), in a detached worktree at `ab8a41dc`.
  - It was started while the Mac run was awaited; the tag's claim counted the half, 291 of 292.
  - Its result is recorded here when it ends.

## 2026-10-20: the go-lisp, ghc-lisp and rust-lisp checkouts removed; their patches kept

- **Why:** Arbace's surveys and specs cite the three forks as prior art for repr/go, repr/haskell
  and repr/rust (G2C-SURVEY, REPR-HASKELL-SURVEY, REPR-RUST-SURVEY, doc/go/SPEC.md,
  doc/haskell/SPEC.md, doc/rust/SPEC.md). No script, build or check of Arbace reads them.
- **Checked first:** each local checkout equalled its GitHub origin (every branch, a clean tree, no
  tags or stashes), checked with `git ls-remote` without writing to them.
- **The patches** are kept in a new private repository, github.com/arbace/forks (`a21d047`), by the
  user's choice. Each fork's own commits are there as `git format-patch BASE..HEAD`:
  - go-lisp: 27 patches on golang/go `f043823a`, head `2483a496`;
  - ghc-lisp: 25 on GHC's `c35096f5`, head `db7adf93`;
  - rust-lisp: 11 on rust-lang/rust `602727f2`, head `f28e0de8`.
  It has no merges or binary files, about 1.4 MB.
  - Each series applied to its base (with `git apply --cached` in a throwaway bare clone) gives
    the head's tree exactly.
  - Each base is a commit of its upstream (GitHub's and GHC's GitLab's APIs).
  - A fresh clone of arbace/forks equals the local files byte for byte.
  The repository's README says how to restore a fork and under which upstream license each
  series is.
  - Alternatives considered: a release asset on GitHub (rejected: it lives only on GitHub's
    servers, outside any clone) and the patches inside Arbace (rejected: three more upstream
    licenses for files Arbace does not use).
- **Removed:** `/root/go-lisp`, `/root/ghc-lisp` and `/root/rust-lisp` (about 3.6 GB), at the
  user's word. The forks themselves stay on GitHub (go-lisp and ghc-lisp public, rust-lisp
  private). The specs' citations keep their commits; their local paths now name what was there.

## 2026-10-20: the forks deleted from GitHub; their record is arbace/forks

- The user deleted github.com/arbace/go-lisp, arbace/ghc-lisp and arbace/rust-lisp. They had no
  watchers, forks or stars. In the user's words, these projects were pathfinders for Arbace's
  forms: Go, Haskell and Rust written as s-expressions and compiled beside their ordinary source,
  the prior art of repr/go, repr/haskell and repr/rust.
- Their contributions are kept in the private repository github.com/arbace/forks (`a21d047`; the
  entry above): each fork's patch series on its upstream base, checked to give the fork head's
  tree exactly. Its README says how to restore a fork.
- The citations in Arbace's surveys and specs (doc/G2C-SURVEY.md, doc/REPR-HASKELL-SURVEY.md,
  doc/REPR-RUST-SURVEY.md, doc/go/SPEC.md, doc/go/ROUNDTRIP.md, doc/haskell/SPEC.md,
  doc/rust/SPEC.md) name the forks by repository, branch and commit. Those commits are now
  reachable only by applying arbace/forks' patches to the upstream bases: golang/go `f043823a`,
  GHC `c35096f5`, rust-lang/rust `602727f2`. The citations are left as written, a dated record.

## 2026-10-20: "written entirely in symbolic expressions"

The user found the one-line description imprecise, "a Clojure derivative written entirely in
Clojure", and chose "Arbace is a Clojure derivative written entirely in symbolic expressions". It is
more precise because Arbace's own code is Clojure plus the Java forms and the Go forms (jrt, goi,
`tamago/`, `box/`), all s-expressions but not all Clojure. The sentence changed in three places:
GitHub's repository description, README's first line and CLAUDE.md's.

## 2026-10-20: two surveys started: a native Go parser, a native Java front end

- **The user's request:** plans for an Arbace-native Go parser and an Arbace-native Java front
  end.
- **Why these two:** the readers of repr/go and repr/java are not Arbace's own.
  - repr/go reads through `tools/godump`, Go's go/parser and go/types in a Go helper.
  - repr/java reads through javac's internals on the frozen JVM jar: Arbace's last real JVM
    dependency besides the oracle's reference.
  - repr/clojure's reader is already Arbace's own.
- **Started:** two surveys, each in its own worktree from `9a6a36e9`:
  - `go-parser-survey`, writing doc/go/GO-PARSER-SURVEY.md (proposals GPS1-);
  - `java-frontend-survey`, writing doc/classes/JAVA-FRONTEND-SURVEY.md (proposals JFS1-).
- **What each weighs:**
  - prior art: go/parser and gc's syntax; javac, ECJ and JavaParser;
  - a hand-written Arbace reader against running the language's own front end from its forms:
    gc's parser is already Go forms in `tamago/cmd/`, and javac's Java could be converted by
    repr/java;
  - what Arbace already has: goi's checker, an Arbace go/types; `arbace.classes`, javac's analysis
    over Java forms;
  - the forms' equality with today's readers over every corpus, as the check of the switch;
  - milestones and effort.

## 2026-10-20: goi's check in the emulated arm64 box over all of box.txt

- **What:** `GOI_BOX_ALL=1 bin/box-arm64-vm goi` (no `--record`) in a detached worktree at
  `ab8a41dc`, with the program of the seed `fcc37393…`. It was started while the Mac run was
  awaited and was left out of the tag's claim, which counted the half: 291 of 292.
- **Result:** 584 programs: 582 pass, 0 fail, 0 error, 2 known. 9,690 s (2 h 41 min), 8 boxes of 2
  vCPUs, host load about 14. One program, `copy.go`, timed out in the parallel round and passed
  alone (`babde67d`'s retry).
- **Against the references:**
  - all 292 programs of the recorded half (`test/goi/check-box-arm64.edn`) as recorded;
  - against amd64's box reference, one difference: `fixedbugs/issue15277.go`, known on arm64
    because its build constraint is amd64.
  - The 2 known are in classes of `test/goi/divergences.edn`: `typeparam/issue50109.go` (the box's
    console) and issue15277 (another architecture's program).
  - It is the first emulated run to include issue15277. The Mac's run of all 584 gave the same 582
    and 2.
- **No file changed:** the half stays the recorded reference (GC75).

## 2026-10-20: the Java front end's survey merged (doc/classes/JAVA-FRONTEND-SURVEY.md)

- Branch `java-frontend-survey` (`145e64d8`, from `9a6a36e9`) merged. No JVM or Go build was run:
  the measurements are over the committed `jdk/forms`, the last `bin/gate --full`'s reports, jdk26u
  at `baf63fb` and shallow clones of the prior art.
- **Finding: it is not mostly a parser.**
  - 77% of `convert.ae`'s code lines read javac's attribution.
  - In jdk/forms, 25.0% of the lists have a head chosen by name and member resolution and 14.4% by
    expression types; 60.6% follow from syntax alone.
  - `arbace.classes` has no generic types in code (SPEC principle 4), so it covers about a third of
    the attribution. The rest is javac's own: about 47,000 lines of Attr, Resolve, Infer and
    Types, against about 9,300 for its parser.
  - Only javac makes javac's class files, which the round trip's classes level compares.
- **Prior art, measured:**
  - javac (`jdk.compiler`, 162,441 lines, GPLv2+CE, already in LICENSE.md);
  - ECJ (241,716, EPL-2.0);
  - JavaParser (99,905 plus 32,375 for its symbol solver);
  - tree-sitter-java (syntax only).
- **Recommended: (b), javac itself as Java forms, run by Arbace** (D12 (b) of STANDALONE-SURVEY),
  in a tool executable translated by j2g, with `convert.ae` on top unchanged.
  - repr/java converted `jdk.compiler` once already (2026-10-07: 342 of 347 files).
  - jrt lacks about 67 of the 238 java.base classes javac names (an over-count, to be measured).
  - A native front end, (a), is estimated at 30-50 days with an open tail, and cannot give the
    classes level.
- **Milestones:** JF1-JF6, the switch off the JVM, about 13-20 days; then JF7-JF9 later.
- **What stays on the JVM afterwards:** the oracle's reference, j2g's edge, `check --suite` and the
  data generators.
- **Proposals JFS1-JFS11** are open, for the user. JFS11 notes that the milestone prefix JF
  collides with PRINTER-NOTES' decided JF1-JF5, and recommends JN1-JN9 instead.
