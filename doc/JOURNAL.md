# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

This journal starts over after the milestone `arbace-inside-itself-v1`, by the user's decision
(2026-10-15), as it did at the two freezes. The history before it is on the frozen branches, at
the tag and in git history:

- 2026-10-06 to 2026-10-08 (the class forms, j2c, the vendored and self-hosting Clojure, the work
  for Java 26, the g2c survey): on
  [`arbace-for-java-26`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-java-26/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-java-26-v1`;
- 2026-10-08 to 2026-10-11 (milestone B1a: g2c, c2g, jrt, the evaluator, the Go executable and
  its feature completion, the freeze of the Go build): on
  [`arbace-for-golang`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-golang/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-go1.27.1-v1`;
- 2026-10-11 to 2026-10-15 (the `.ae` sources, c2a, B1b the box and its milestones
  `arbace-box-amd64-v1`, `arbace-box-arm64-v1`; the standalone Arbace S1-S8 and the milestones
  `arbace-seed-is-go-v1`, `arbace-inside-itself-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-inside-itself-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-inside-itself-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `e0ad476`).

## 2026-10-15: the journal starts over

- The user's decision, after the milestone `arbace-inside-itself-v1` (tag on main, not a freeze:
  no branch): this journal starts over; the earlier one, 1,535 lines from 2026-10-11 to the
  milestone's entry, is at the tag (linked above). CLAUDE.md's Records paragraph names the three
  places of the history.
- Still running at the reset: the whole chain in the emulated arm64 VM, nothing given (BX117 (a),
  `.tmp/s8c/run.sh` at `434021a`, started 2026-10-14 22:49): its namespaces compiled in 8,839 s
  (127 times the amd64 box's); its result is recorded here when it ends.
- Next, the user's order: the docs searched for sloppiness, then the build's speed (the agenda's
  "Later": the builds keep 5 to 9 of the host's 64 cores busy).

## 2026-10-15: the docs searched for sloppiness

The user's order: four read-only audits of the repository's Markdown (35,940 lines; README,
CLAUDE.md, `doc/`, `box/README.md`, `tamago/README.md`, `LICENSE.md`'s coverage), then four
fixes on branches `docs-1` to `docs-4`, one set of files each, merged (`8d8e87c`, `36e1356`,
`5ccdf7e`, `f0dd320`); the state documents (the agenda rewritten, CLAUDE.md's direction, the
README) on main (`0df2cdf`). About 120 findings, of these kinds:
- present state left stale: statuses and "Left"/"Next" lists of work since done (S4-S8, the
  Mac's run, HV1-HV9's decisions, BX12-BX17, AOT "not scheduled" though the default since S6),
  sizes and counts given as current (the seed 3 MB, now 5.4; 75 MB, now 101.3; jdk's 835 files,
  now 838);
- names that no longer exist: `bin/arbace-j`, `bin/arbace-box`, `bin/java-surface`,
  `arbace/lang/go/ns/` and the hand-written variants merged by SA150, `test/arbace-results.edn`,
  `seed/arbace-seed.jar`, `bin/seed --go-*`, `known-box-amd64.edn`;
- the tools described as loaded from the checkout, though compiled into the host since S6
  (SA133), also in the headers of `bin/a2g`, `bin/g2a-print`, `bin/lib/g2a-host.bash`,
  `bin/lib/tools.bash`;
- references to journal entries now at the tag `arbace-inside-itself-v1` or on the frozen
  branches (one quoted title renamed by the tools' rename: "g2c's open questions");
- `LICENSE.md`: the Go-source seed was covered by no entry (added: its parts and the licenses
  they carry, each one already recorded); `box/`'s `tool` and `tree` added as Arbace's own;
- typos ("a a2g", 17 times), a garbled sentence, missing blank lines before headings.
Kept as decided: the user's git identity where the docs name the commits' author; public
endpoints; HOST-VM-SURVEY's list of absent devices (no provider named). Dated history was
annotated, not rewritten. Left: `arbace/c2a/rules.ae`'s `:why` for "Optional modules" (code)
still names the runtime image.

## 2026-10-15: the build's speed

The user's order, after the docs: a build (about 4.5 minutes) kept few of the 64 cores busy; aim
2 to 3 minutes. Branch `speed`, merged (`9b62cd2`); recorded in `doc/STANDALONE-NOTES.md`, "After
the milestone: the build's speed". Measured on the shared host while the emulated arm64 VM ran
(single timings vary by up to a fifth): each phase's cores sampled each second, a2g's CPU
profiled (`ARBACE_CPUPROFILE`, `go tool pprof` of TamaGo's toolchain).

Found and changed:
- a2g's analysis spent 13% of its CPU (and much of its garbage) in one reflective call: the
  class forms' `parse-method-desc` called `indexOf(String, int)` with a long; the analysis'
  class-info cache (`arbace.classes.env/reflect-cache`) was untyped (reflective) and behind one
  lock taken by every lookup from 16 threads; the back end's `registered?` lost a hint. Fixed
  (40 reflection warnings in the tools' namespaces, the rest cold).
- a2g loads in two rounds (the runtime's classes, then the compiled namespaces'), and with
  `--await` starts while the host compiles the namespaces, analyzing the runtime meanwhile; its
  output does not depend on the wait (checked: byte for byte with `--input`) (SA160).
- a2g read every file of a tree whole, one after another, to find its package files (16 s for
  the compiled namespaces' 28 MB): now their first form.
- report.edn printed directly, not by `arbace.pprint` (18 s at the end) (SA161); g2a's
  amd64 and arm64 builds at once (SA162); `jdk/edge.edn` out of the runtime key, as a2g's data
  (SA163).
Tried and left: `GOGC` higher within the same memory limit (slower), 32 jobs (no gain: bound by
Go's collector).

Results: a2g alone about 100 s (was 160 to 210); the fixpoint's one-run builds 2:57 and 2:44
(were 4:13, 4:19); the essential gate passed on the branch (10:58); the fixpoint G1 = G2 = G3
byte for byte. The seed remade from the fixpoint at `d23bc5e`, `79d4f552...` (was
`c7f5e3d5...`), and verified (stage 0 = G1 = G2 = G3, `b6f2e89e...`). Left: the host's
compiling of the namespaces (about 60 s; its emit sequential by its shared constant pools),
a2g's reachability (19 s) and sequential translation steps (18 s), and `jrt`, one Go package,
the long pole of g2a's builds. SA160-SA163 proposed for the user, recommended (a).
