# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

## 2026-10-06: Repository bootstrap

- The repo started from GitHub's profile-README template (`arbace/arbace`). Its `.gitignore` is
  GitHub's Leiningen template.
- Added `.claude/` (local Claude Code settings) and `.tmp/` (scratch space for temporaries) to
  `.gitignore`. Both patterns are unanchored. Created `.tmp/`.
- Defined the project: Arbace is a from-scratch reimplementation of Clojure in Clojure. Studying and
  vendoring prior art is always allowed. The work is a derivation done once by hand, and this journal
  exists so it could be repeated.
- Prior art:
  - https://github.com/clojure/clojure for the language.
  - https://github.com/openjdk/jdk26u for the native runtime.
  - https://github.com/golang/go as a slimmer, appealing runtime and anything else useful from
    it, except the Go language itself.
- Replaced the template README.md. Added CLAUDE.md, doc/AGENDA.md (the current state, rewritten
  freely) and doc/JOURNAL.md (this file, append-only).

## 2026-10-06: Seed from Clojure and ASM sources (SEED.bash)

- Added `SEED.bash`, which vendors upstream sources into a single tree, `clojure/`, compiles them in
  place, and smoke-tests the result. Its steps:
  - Shallow-clone https://gitlab.ow2.org/asm/asm and https://github.com/clojure/clojure into `_/`.
    The script does not pin revisions. The seed was taken at these revisions:
    - asm `0460f74ba64230e5b846967c81a52628b5dd0596`
    - clojure `98d735fab02f337cee654cb0629bddc09883a75a` (`1.13.0-master-SNAPSHOT`)
  - Take all of `asm/src/main/java/org/objectweb/asm`, plus `GeneratorAdapter`,
    `InstructionAdapter`, `LocalVariablesSorter`, `Method` and `TableSwitchGenerator` from
    asm-commons. Rename the package `org.objectweb` to `clojure` (giving `clojure.asm`), which
    replaces Clojure's own repackaged copy.
  - Take Clojure's `src/jvm` Java sources, except its bundled `clojure/asm`, and its `src/clj`
    sources, except `clojure/parallel`. Write `clojure/version.properties` from `pom.xml`.
  - Normalize the files: squeeze blank lines, retab to width 2, strip trailing whitespace.
  - Stub out clojure.spec, which is a separate library: comment out the `[clojure.spec.alpha :as
    spec]` require and the spec checks in macroexpansion, the `*explain-out*` use and the doc
    `describe` call. Replace the `clojure.spec.skip-macros` check with `false`.
  - Run `javac -g` over the tree. The result runs `clojure.main`:
    `(reduce + (map inc [1 2 3]))` evaluates to 9.
- The result is 183 `.java` files and 48 `.clj` files under `clojure/`. The compiled `.class`
  files are already gitignored.
- Licenses: Clojure is EPL-1.0 and ASM is BSD-3-Clause (INRIA, France Telecom).

## 2026-10-06: Freeze clojure/, drop SEED.bash, add LICENSE.md

- `clojure/` is the frozen reference baseline for the rewrite and is never modified. The rewrite
  lives outside it.
- `SEED.bash` was committed together with `clojure/` in `d21dc91` and then deleted from the
  worktree because it is fragile. It is kept only in git history. The upstream revisions are pinned
  in the previous entry.
- Added `LICENSE.md`, which concatenates the vendored licenses:
  - Clojure's EPL-1.0, converted to Markdown from `epl-v10.html` at clojure `98d735fab02f`.
  - ASM's BSD-3-Clause, verbatim from `LICENSE.txt` at asm `0460f74ba642`.
