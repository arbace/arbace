# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

This journal starts over after the milestone `arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1`, by the user's decision (2026-11-07). It
started over the same way at the two freezes and after the milestones `arbace-inside-itself-v1`,
`arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`, `arbace-reaps-3-crops-v1` and `arbace-reaps-3-crops-v2`. The history before it is on the
frozen branches, at five tags, and in git history:

- 2026-10-06 to 2026-10-08 (the class forms, j2c, the vendored and self-hosting Clojure, the work
  for Java 26, the g2c survey): on
  [`arbace-for-java-26`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-java-26/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-java-26-v1`;
- 2026-10-08 to 2026-10-11 (milestone B1a: g2c, c2g, jrt, the evaluator, the Go executable and
  its feature completion, the freeze of the Go build): on
  [`arbace-for-golang`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-golang/doc/JOURNAL.md),
  tag `arbace-for-go1.27.1-v1`;
- 2026-10-11 to 2026-10-15 (the `.ae` sources, c2a, B1b the box and its milestones
  `arbace-box-amd64-v1`, `arbace-box-arm64-v1`; the standalone Arbace S1-S8 and the milestones
  `arbace-seed-is-go-v1`, `arbace-inside-itself-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-inside-itself-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-inside-itself-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `e0ad476`);
- 2026-10-15 to 2026-10-20 (S9, Go's toolchain as forms; the docs' audit; the build's speed; the
  renames to repr/java, repr/go, repr/clojure, c2j and j2g; Futamura's F2-F7; repr/java print;
  repr/haskell R1-R6 and HR25; repr/rust RR1-RR6; goi GR0-GR10, the arm64 box check, GC81, and
  the milestone `arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-interprets-go1.27.1-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `965cbed3`).
- 2026-10-20 to 2026-10-27 (the Go parser GP1-GP8 and its surveys; the Java front end's native parser,
  converter and attribution JN8-JN9d; Java's conformance check JC1-JC6b; goi after v1; the REAP survey and
  REAP1-REAP9, the three crops' matrix; three batched re-seeds; the parked sub-projects; the milestone
  `arbace-reaps-3-crops-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-reaps-3-crops-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-reaps-3-crops-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `83538e0b`).
- 2026-10-27 to 2026-11-01 (the scripts' sweep; the efficient gate GT1-GT7 and its clean run; REAP's small and medium
  leftovers: JC4b, JC4c, Clojure's deferred cases, JN9e, JN9f and JFS133, RPS150, RPS97 and RPS161; bin/java-check's
  shadowed judge and the Java levels re-recorded; two re-seeds; C23's survey and C1-C3; the net/http survey, NH0 and
  NH1; the OCaml, Scheme and C++23 surveys; the milestone `arbace-reaps-3-crops-v2`): at the tag
  [`arbace-reaps-3-crops-v2`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-reaps-3-crops-v2/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `c4f85ace`).
- 2026-11-01 to 2026-11-07 (the merge window after v2; C8 and C9, C the fourth row, and its re-seed window; the test
  budget, GT8's compressed corpora and tiers, the staging branch `next`; the crops unparked and surveyed, OCaml, Scheme,
  C++, LLVM IR, Haskell, Rust and Python on branches; the re-seed `d5548e72`; the clean run of the four crops and its two
  reruns; the milestone `arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1`): at the tag
  [`arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1/doc/JOURNAL.md)
  (main's `a4a84533`).

## 2026-11-07: the journal starts over

- **The user's decision** of 2026-11-07 ("tag it when the gate passes, then reset the journal"): the milestone
  `arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1`, an annotated tag as v2's, on main's `a4a84533` (the record's commit `99873f98` with the tag's
  docs and the record above it, the essential gate passed on it), made by the session at the user's go-ahead; this
  journal starts over after it.
  - The earlier one, 474 lines and 18 entries from 2026-11-01 to the tag's entry, is at the tag (linked above).
  - CLAUDE.md's Records paragraph, the agenda's header and README name the seven places of the history.
- **Where things stand** (doc/AGENDA.md): the REAP matrix at the tag, 16 of 16 cells checked, none failing, every
  non-pass in a recorded class (doc/FULL-SUPPORT-SURVEY.md, "REAP v3's divergences"); the clean record
  `test/gate/clean-arbace-reaps-4-crops-v1.edn` (234 steps, three runs, 77,700 s); the seed `d5548e72`.
- **Next** (doc/AGENDA.md, "After the tag"): the after-tag fixes (`.tmp/tag-v2/ppcheck-srcdir.patch`: `embed-11.c`'s
  digest writes `${srcdir}` and `absolute-name` goes; crops-score's CSP5 goi patch), a whole `--full` night to complete
  the rotation (nine parts incomplete at the tag), then the held branches in batches into `next`
  (`.tmp/tag-v2/merge-plan.md`; the `arbace/cpp/lower.ae` conflict between `llvm-ll6` and `cppi-deferred`), each batch's
  night records, and Python's branch from the Mac VM.

## 2026-11-06: the day's work, held for after the tag (recorded after the tag)

Not journaled before the tag (the night's clean rerun held the session). The user, 2026-11-06 07:22: spend the weekly
allowance on the crops' completeness, maturity and independence. Fifteen Opus agents on branches, sample checks only,
under the day's rules (light on the host; main frozen until the record), all pushed to `mac` and held for after the tag;
then further agents as the first finished. Each branch's doc records its work, its proposals and the user's decisions;
the night commands each needs are in its doc.

- **OCaml** (`ocaml-t12`): the native path 244 to 273 of 309, equal to ocamlc's; TY23 (a) built, TY24 (a) prepared
  (native the default after the night's record). `ocaml-libs4`: eval 428 / 125 / 118 to 441 / 205 / 25, AOT 394 / 114 /
  159 to 405 / 202 / 64; OT27-OT29 decided.
- **Haskell** (`haskell-hf7`): programs run from our STG 16 to 60 of 63. `haskell-eval9`: testsuite core 600 to 666 of
  701, check-hsi 806 of 910, AOT 209 programs; HES80-HES82 decided. `haskell-simpl`: GHC's -O0 simplifier ported, the
  default; Core 37 to 53 of 61.
- **Rust** (`rust-rf14`): RF7's collection 1,189 of 1,191 items, RF9a's type checking; `rust-rf9b`: typeck 99.7% on the
  samples, 99.6% on the crates; RFP14-RFP21 decided. `rust-re6`: threads on ci as goroutines over musl's futexes,
  posix_spawn, signals, LTO; samples 69 of 69, UI sample 90 of 93; RES46-RES53 proposed.
- **C++** (`cpp-g5`): P15-P16, new/delete, initializer lists, iostream: the corpus sample 7 to 32 of 42.
  `cppi-deferred`: long double layout, float atomics, va_arg on ci. `oracle-records-cpp2`: the five packs re-recorded
  deterministically, ORS28 (b). P17-P19, CP230, CP231 decided.
- **LLVM IR** (`llvm-ll6`): eval 229 to 519 of 562 modules, AOT recorded, no LLVM tool at check time; LLS23-LLS26 decided
  (LLS26: the torture IR pack is GPL test data, its text in LICENSE.md).
- **Scheme** (`scheme-smr7`): psyntax boots on si (no Chez), Chez's format floats ported; mats 436 to 560 pass.
- **Java** (`java-jc9c`): F6, F12, F13 (java.lang.management), F19 write-ahead; JCS158-JCS161 decided.
- **Go** (`goi-escape`): gc's escape analysis ported for `-m`: 58 of 96 such tests, goi check 1,664 to 1,722 of 1,837
  (rows hand-written until the night's `--record`).
- **C** (`c-deferred`): VLA structs, complex integers, signals, self-include: eval and AOT deferred 33 to 6, print 78 to
  45; CS274-CS278 decided (CS278 after the tag).
- **Clojure** (`clojure-cdr`): CDR1-CDR11 built or started; eval 21,053 / 81 / 1 to an expected 21,110 / 18 / 1-2 after
  the night's conversion and build.
- **The crops' score** (`crops-score`): `bin/crops-score` (`doc/CROPS-SCORE.md`): completeness, maturity and
  independence per crop; CSP1-CSP5 decided and built.
- **Incidents:** `goi-escape`'s hard-linked corpus summaries rewrote main's scratch summaries
  (`.tmp/repr-go/forms/linux-{test,dirtest,errtest}`, `.tmp/godump/corpus/linux-errtest`; only `:seconds` expected to
  differ; the clean rerun used its own clone, unaffected); two rule slips
  (memory peaks of 5.6 and 6.4 GB in a day's check; one `<(...)`).
