# Journal

An append-only log of important decisions and actions, oldest first. Never edit past entries; add
a new entry to correct or supersede one. The goal is that the progress could be recreated from this
log.

The journal up to the freeze (2026-10-06 to 2026-10-08: the class forms, j2c, the vendored and
self-hosting Clojure, the work for Java 26, the g2c survey) is on the branch
[`arbace-for-java-26`](https://github.com/arbace/arbace/blob/arbace-for-java-26/doc/JOURNAL.md),
tag `arbace-for-java-26-v1`, and in git history. This journal starts over there, by the user's
decision (2026-10-08).

## 2026-10-08: The freeze; the repository made public

- `bin/freeze --run-gate --yes` ran the gate locally on main `38a652d` and passed:
  - stages 1-3 identical at 5,756 classes, the verifier clean at class file version 70;
  - native tests 47/2,780;
  - Clojure's suite 20,750/20,750 on stages 1 and 2;
  - `bin/class-forms-tests` 64/133;
  - `bin/j2c-check --suite` without regressions.
- It then created and pushed the branch `arbace-for-java-26` at `38a652d` and the annotated tag
  `arbace-for-java-26-v1` (`2fbde83`), whose message records the commit and the gate. The push
  started the branch's CI run (actions run 37749231098). `doc/FREEZE.md` describes the branch.
- At the user's request the GitHub repository `arbace/arbace` was made public, after a scan of
  the tracked files and history for credentials (none). Commit author lines carry the user's
  name and email.
- Main now moves toward the standalone Arbace (`doc/AGENDA.md`). Next on main, as decided:
  `clojure/` is replaced by a binary seed (the jar built from the freeze tag, pinned by hash).
